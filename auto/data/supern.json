Years later, while attending Stanford University, Sam is forced back into the paranormal world by Dean, who has come to tell him that their father is missing. The two travel to Jericho, California, to find him, but their search is put on hold when they discover that a ghostly Woman in White (Sarah Shahi)—the spirit of a woman who drowned her children and then killed herself—has been taking male victims. They investigate, but Dean is arrested for impersonating a federal agent. However, he manages to escape custody, and saves his brother from the vengeful spirit. The Woman in White is finally put to rest after the brothers force her to confront the spirits of her children. Sam later returns home but discovers his girlfriend Jessica (Adrianne Palicki) pinned to the ceiling. He is then forced to watch as she is killed in the same supernatural manner as his mother was. Jessica's death prompts him to return to the life of hunting with Dean.",

After the brothers leave, they are confronted by Bela. Using the pseudonym of \"Alex\", she \"solved\" the case for Gertrude, who has withheld payment since the Winchesters arrived. More deaths occur that night, and the brothers realize that the ship is a death omen linked to the spirit of a sailor hanged for treason. The sailor's hand was crafted in a Hand of Glory. Bela suggests that they destroy it to stop the ghost ship. Using tickets provided by Gertrude, the trio attends a lavish function at the local Maritime Museum. Bela steals the hand, but sneaks away from the brothers. She sells the hand to a client—her goal all along—but then sees the ghost ship. With her death imminent, Bela turns to the Winchesters for help. They have discovered that the spirit only targets people responsible for the deaths of family members, which Bela will not elaborate on. The three of them conduct a summoning ritual at the sailor's grave. The vengeful spirit is confronted by the captain who ordered his death—his brother—and both disappear.",

She rebukes his threats to kill her unless she reveals the location of the brothers, but eventually acquiesces in exchange for a priceless mojo bag. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean capture and interrogate the vampire Lucy (Mercedes McNab), and learn that another vampire named Dixon (Matthew Humphreys) transformed her by spiking her drink with his own blood at a club in Albany, New York. Dean is forced to kill Lucy, as there is no known cure for vampirism. The brothers locate and confront Dixon, but are interrupted by Gordon and Kubrick. Sam and Dean escape, but in the mayhem, Dixon kidnaps Gordon. Though Dixon had planned on using Gordon as food, the hunter's continuous taunting prompts him to feed him his blood. When the brothers—having been informed by Bela of Gordon's location, which she discovered via Ouija board—arrive at Dixon's hideout, they discover that the vampiric Gordon has escaped. Elsewhere, Gordon returns to Kubrick, but kills him in self-defense. As night approaches, the brothers have not been able to find Gordon. Dean decides to go after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his reckless behavior since his deal; Dean relents and agrees to behave more like his old self again. Gordon later calls Sam and Dean, threatening to kill a young woman if they do not meet him. They head to the location and find the woman, but Gordon uses a rollerdoor to separate the brothers. The woman is revealed to be a vampire turned by Gordon. While Dean is forced to shoot her with the Colt, Sam decapitates Gordon with a razor wire. The brothers later stop on the side of the road to check a rattling noise made by the Impala, and Dean begins teaching Sam how to repair the car since his time is running out.",

    "description": "\nWhen a being dressed as Santa Claus begins killing people after dragging them up the chimney, the Winchesters head to Ypsilanti, Michigan to investigate. Sam suspects that an evil version of Santa—many world lores tell of those who punish the wicked during Christmas—is at work. He notices that over both victims' fireplaces are the same wreaths made of meadowsweet, a herb often used in pagan rituals to lure gods to a human sacrifice. The brothers track down the makers of the wreaths, a pair of pagan gods posing as the apparently perfect Edward (Spencer Garrett) and Madge Carrigan (Merrilyn Gann). However, they are captured as intended human sacrifices. When the Carrigans are distracted by a neighbor at the front door, the Winchesters break free. Knowing that the gods can be killed by evergreen wood, they stab the gods to death with branches of the Christmas tree.\nThroughout the episode, the brothers debate celebrating Christmas after having skipped the tradition for years. Dean wants to celebrate because it will be his last chance, while Sam does not for the same reason. Flashbacks accompany this, depicting a young Sam (Colin Ford) and Dean (Ridge Canipe) on Christmas Eve of 1991. With their father out on a hunt, the brothers are staying alone in a motel room until he returns. Sam, having read his father's hunting journal, is finally told the truth by Dean about what their father does. Later that night, Dean steals gifts from a nearby house to make it look like their father dropped off presents. Knowing the truth but appreciating what Dean tried to do for him, Sam gives him the gift meant for their father—the amulet necklace that Dean has worn ever since. As the episode ends in the present, Dean is surprised to find that Sam has decorated their motel room with Christmas paraphernalia, now wanting to celebrate with him.",

Ruby shows up and warns them that a powerful force is controlling the witches. The force will likely target Sam, so Ruby advises him to leave town. The brothers ignore her pleas and head back to their motel. Dean confronts Sam about his lack of concern over killing people, so Sam explains that he is just trying to be more like him in order to prepare himself to fight alone in the upcoming demon war. Intense pain suddenly overcomes Dean, who is being attacked through magic. Sam is unable to find the hex bag—a small bag of various ingredients that witches use to focus their magic onto a target—and instead decides to go after the witches with the Colt. Ruby arrives shortly after and is able to save Dean from the spell with a potion. Elsewhere, the three women deny targeting Dean, and claim that they have only used witchcraft for personal gain. Sam realizes that Tammi (Marisa Ramirez), who has not benefited from the coven, is what Ruby warned him about. Tammi incapacitates Sam and kills one of the women. She stops a bullet from the Colt in mid-air with telekinesis, and subdues Dean when he attacks. Ruby tries to trick Tammi by claiming she led the Winchesters right to her, but fails in her attempt to kill the powerful demon. The other witch begins reciting a spell. Tammi quickly kills her, but the distraction gives Dean enough time to stab Tammi with Ruby's knife. Later that night, Ruby admits to Dean that she cannot save him from his deal. She also reveals that all demons were once humans, but have had their humanity stripped away in Hell. Like the coven, she was also a witch who sold her soul to Tammi, but for some reason still remembers what it is like to be human. Ruby requests Dean's help in preparing Sam for the future.",

The brothers search Bobby's motel room and find a newspaper article about a doctor who suffered a sleep-related death.

That night, they break into the attraction, but are confronted by the owner who inadvertently kills Dean with his shotgun. To Sam's surprise, he sees Dean when he wakes up the next morning, once again getting dressed and lip-syncing to \"Heat of the Moment\". The day appears to be repeating itself, so Sam suggests they visit the Mystery Spot during the day. As Dean agrees, he is killed by a speeding car. The time loop continues, with Dean's getting killed in various ways despite Sam's attempts to circumvent it. One hundred Tuesdays later, an agitated Sam notices that the man at the diner is using a different syrup than before. He confronts the man, who reveals himself as the Trickster (Richard Speight, Jr.): a demi-god who enjoys playing fatal pranks on the pompous (he previously dealt with the Winchesters in an episode at a college campus). The Trickster admits to starting the time loop to convince Sam that he cannot save Dean, but offers to return time to normal. When Sam still tries to kill him, the Trickster snaps his fingers and initiates the next morning (Wednesday). The Winchesters decide to leave town, but Dean is gunned down in an attempted mugging. With the time loop broken, Dean remains dead. Months pass, and a distant Sam has become a lone hunter in his search for the Trickster. He ignores Bobby's numerous calls, but eventually hears a message claiming that he has located the Trickster. The two hunters reunite at the Mystery Spot, where Bobby prepares a summoning ritual. Realizing the truth, Sam stabs Bobby in the heart with a wooden stake in an attempt to kill the Trickster, however it is but an illusion as the real Trickster appears. Sam begs that Dean be brought back to life and they would not hunt the Trickster anymore. The Trickster points out that Dean is his weakness; both brothers are always willing to sacrifice themselves for one another, and their enemies know it. He restores the timeline to Wednesday with both Dean and Sam intact.",

    "description": "Ruby returns to give Sam and Dean a lead: other demons are searching for an escaped mental patient named Anna Milton (Julie McNiven), who was locked up after she went into hysterics because she heard angels talking in her head about the upcoming Apocalypse and needed to be restrained after trying to warn people. Sam and Dean investigate and find that Ruby was telling the truth and that Anna's claims about the Apocalypse are uncannily accurate. After finding her parents dead at her home, Sam and Dean track Anna to her father's church, where Ruby arrives to warn them that one of the \"heavy-hitter\" demons looking for Anna has been following them since Anna's house. They are unable to escape before the demon attacks them. It is then revealed that the new demon, whose name is Alastair (Mark Rolston), knows Dean from his time in Hell. While Alastair takes Sam out and beats on Dean, Ruby escapes with Anna. Sam recovers and stabs Alastair with Ruby's knife; while it doesn't kill him, it gives the Winchesters the chance to flee to safety. Believing they were set up by Ruby, Dean lashes out at Sam for trusting her, so Sam tells him what happened during the months Dean was in Hell. Sam's account is depicted in flashbacks; the flashbacks show him encountered Ruby (Anna Williams) again for the first time since Dean's death, while drunk and trying in vain to bring Dean back. Though Ruby had been tortured and eventually released from Hell by Lilith only on the condition that she kill Sam, she had only agreed to it to trick Lilith into setting her free, as she still wanted to help Sam. However, Sam rejected her because she couldn't save Dean from Hell, and demanded that she leave her host body to spare the host. Ruby acquiesced and possessed the body of a brain-dead coma patient (Cortese) whose life support had just been cut so that she would not be usurping someone else's life. She then returned to Sam and he agreed to let her teach him how to use his powers to kill Lilith and avenge Dean. In the meantime, she made him quit drinking and provided him with some physical comfort when she seduced him. She finally earned his trust when she came after him and saved him from a trap Lilith had prepared for him, even though he had threatened to kill her if she tried to intervene. After the last flashback, Ruby briefly takes a different host (Michelle-Hewitt Williams) to find the Winchesters and give them Anna's location. There, Dean extends an olive branch of sorts to Ruby (Cortese) due to his appreciation of how she helped Sam in his absence, and Sam is forced to break the news to a devastated Anna that her parents are dead. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, with Castiel and Uriel appearing and demanding to be taken to Anna so that they can kill her.",

    "description": "Anna banishes Castiel and Uriel by cutting her wrists and drawing a mysterious symbol in her blood, though she doesn't know how she knew to do it. Wanting answers, Dean and Sam call upon Pamela, who uses hypnosis on Anna to unlock her memories of her mysterious early years. Doing so restores Anna's memories of what she truly is: a fallen angel who had become human by ripping out her Grace which she describes as being like an energy that is intrinsic to angels. Sam manages to track down her Grace, which would turn her back into an angel and restore all her powers, but when the group goes to retrieve it, they find that it has already been taken. Anna receives an ultimatum from the angels, that she is to be given to them or else Dean will be sent back to Hell. The group seems to be at a loss for a plan. That night, Anna approaches Dean and tries to broach the subject of what happened in Hell. Although he can't talk about it, she offers him reassurance and kisses him, which culminates in them having sex in the Impala on her last night on Earth. Meanwhile, Ruby goes to Alastair with the proposition of her handing over Anna if he will let her and the Winchesters go. He instead captures and tortures her with her own knife for the others' location. At the same time, Dean is forced to give their location away to Uriel, who has invaded his dreams and is revealed to be the one who took Anna's Grace, under threat to Sam. The demons and angels arrive and battle each other. During the confusion, Anna retrieves her Grace from Uriel. In a flash of light, she becomes an angel again and she and Alastair vanish. Castiel and Uriel, too, leave, in pursuit of Anna. It is revealed that Ruby and Dean betraying the others was all part of Sam's plan to get the angels and demons to fight it out to give them the opportunity they needed. In the episode's ending, Dean confides in Sam that it was forty years in Hell instead of four months and that every day, Alastair tortured him and then offered him release from the torture if he tortured souls himself. After thirty years, Dean finally gave in, but is now haunted by his actions.",

This episode has them investigate a murderous young female spirit inside the walls of a suspected haunted house in Stratton, Nebraska. Complications ensue when a family of five moves in, and the \"spirit\" turns out to be two humans, a young pair of sibling feral children who are the product of incest and years of abuse and who are willing to kill to protect their home. The brothers fail to get the family to leave, but when the son is kidnapped through the walls, they look to Sam and Dean to rescue the boy. Dean manages to rescue the son, but is forced to shoot the feral brother dead in self-defense while the father of the family is forced to stab the girl to death to protect his wife and daughter. In the ending, Dean reflects on the children with pity, sympathizing with them on what they had become after a lifetime of abuse because of how he himself had tortured souls in Hell after being tortured to the breaking point. He believes that he is even worse than the feral children because they hadn't understood what they were doing and took no pleasure in it, whereas he had in Hell, having relished the opportunity to inflict pain on others after having endured so much himself.",

Their investigation leads them to Charlie (John Rubinstein), Jay (Barry Bostwick) and Vernon (Richard Libertini), three friends who were famous magicians in their day but have now been replaced by flashier, younger magicians. Jay's despair over this drives him to perform numerous tricks on-stage that should have killed him and yet come out unscathed, while magicians who had irritated the three older magicians die of mysterious wounds reflective of the trick at the same time. Sam and Dean suspect that Jay is a witch and go after him, but he is innocent. After Charlie is the next victim of his death tricks, Jay realizes that Vernon must be the one responsible and agrees to help Sam and Dean flush him out. However, Vernon is also innocent; the real witch is Charlie, who has faked his death and restored his youth. He had been protecting Jay because he regards Jay and Vernon as true friends, and offers to grant them both eternal youth and immortality as well. Jay refuses the offer and uses a trick to kill him for good in order to save Sam and Dean's lives. However, with Charlie dead and Vernon refusing to speak to him, he is left sad, bitter, and alone. Seeing this, Sam finally agrees to a proposition Ruby had made earlier in the episode to rejoin her in hunting Lilith and practicing his powers, despite that he has strong reservations against one of the unrevealed methods they are using because he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life hunting.",

They discover that Alastair (Christopher Heyerdahl) has kidnapped the town's reaper as part of a scheme to break one of the 66 seals by killing two reapers under the solstice moon, and they seek Pamela's help to stop him by using astral projection. She sends the brothers into the spiritual world, where the reaper Tessa (Lindsey McKeon) finds them and recognizes Dean, reawakening his memories of their encounter in the second season premiere \"In My Time of Dying\" with a kiss. She has come to take over reaping duties for the missing reaper, but gets spirited away by demons instead for them to use as the second reaper sacrifice. The brothers find the building where the demons are hiding, but are trapped by demons, who then go after Pamela and their inert bodies. Alastair succeeds in killing the local reaper, but Sam and Dean, having been taught how to use their spiritual abilities by the ghost of a young boy named Cole (Alexander Gould), manage to break the trap holding Tessa before Alastair can kill her. Tessa repays the favor by freeing the brothers and the three escape before Alastair and the other demons can stop them. Sam is pulled back into his body by Pamela, who has been mortally wounded by a demon. Believing that Pamela cannot see what he is doing, Sam uses his powers to exorcise the demon. However, it is too late to save Pamela, who begins to die due to Tessa beginning to reap the souls of Greybull. Alastair tracks Dean down alone and confronts him, but is captured by angels. Castiel explains to Dean that he had been the one who led them to this case because, although he and the other angels had known Alastair's plan, they hadn't been able to get to Alastair because the building the demons hid in was protected against them. Tessa then enlists Dean's help in convincing Cole to cross-over. After they succeed, she warns him to be wary of the angels and what they promise. At that moment, Pamela finishes in pulling Dean back into his body.

Having captured Alastair, Castiel and Uriel demand that Dean use the torturing skills he learned in Hell to extract information from him so they can stop the murders. Dean refuses, but they transport him there and refuse to let him leave until he finally agrees to it. Anna comes to Castiel when he is alone and questions the morality of forcing Dean to torture Alastair, going so far as to question if God is even the one giving orders anymore, but Castiel rejects her and forces her to leave when she suggests that he work with her. Meanwhile, Sam calls upon Ruby to help him locate Dean because he doesn't believe that Dean can get the information. Sam then begins drinking Ruby's blood in order to regain his diminished power. Drinking her blood is how his powers have grown so much early in the season, and his decision to not drink it is why his powers had weakened. Alastair refuses to break despite the torture a vengeful Dean inflicts on him, but does taunt Dean by telling him that he, Dean, had broken the first seal when he began torturing people in Hell. An unseen force then frees Alastair, who tries to kill Dean and exorcise Castiel. Sam arrives and uses his increased power to torture and kill Alastair after the latter admits that no demon is behind the angel murders. Dean is subsequently taken to a hospital for the injuries he sustained from Alastair's attack. Castiel seeks Anna out and pleads for her to tell him what to do, but she tells him that he must learn to think for himself. Castiel soon realizes who is behind the murders and Alastair's escape: Uriel. Uriel had killed the angels who refused to join him in releasing Lucifer, and had freed Alastair to kill Dean and keep the blame on the demons. When Castiel refuses to join him, Uriel tries to kill him, but is killed by Anna instead, saving Castiel. Afterward, Castiel visits Dean in the hospital and confirms that Dean broke the first seal with his actions in Hell.

Later, Castiel meets up with the Winchesters and tells them that Anna has traveled back in time to 1978 to stop Mary and John Winchester from conceiving Sam.

She has been receiving visions from angels and guiding the townspeople to demons, whom the townspeople always seem to defeat and exorcise. Eventually Leah begins telling the locals that they are \"Chosen\" to win the Apocalypse and see their dead loved ones again in a Paradise on Earth, but to do so must get rid of \"sinners\" among them whose names the angels are giving to her. The brothers learn that Leah has been replaced by the Whore of Babylon, a creature from Hell that emerges during the Apocalypse and tries to condemn as many people as possible to eternal punishment in Hell by tricking them into committing Deadly Sins. The Whore had only been sending locals on demon hunting trips to earn their trust, and the exorcisms are fake. Her true agenda is to cause the townspeople to kill as many of each other as she can, and damn their souls to Hell. She can only be killed with a cypress wooden stake from a tree in Babylon and by the hand of a true servant of Heaven.

However, before they can decide the baby's future, a shape-shifter breaks in and kidnaps the baby. The shape-shifter was apparently the father of all shape-shifters (the alpha), and was much stronger than the others. Samuel secretly talks to someone on the phone promising he'll capture the alpha. After losing the baby, Dean returns to Lisa, and tells her that he is not sure whether he should stay to protect her and Ben, or go to make sure nothing happens to them. Lisa tells Dean to leave, but just come back home whenever he can.",

Castiel confirms the staff of Moses was used to kill the cops and tells Sam and Dean that Heaven is in a state of chaos and civil war between angels and God's weapons have been stolen. The three find that the officers were involved in the shooting of a young man, whose brother has the staff, which he got from an angel in exchange for his soul. Castiel deduces that the angel responsible, Balthazar (Sebastian Roché), has split the staff into pieces to be able to buy more souls. When Castiel confronts Balthazar in his residence, Balthazar explains he deserted Heaven and thanks Castiel for creating the current situation. Raphael arrives and Balthazar leaves Castiel to deal with the mess. Before Castiel is killed by Raphael, Balthazar returns and uses what appears to be a white crystal to disintegrate Raphael's host into salt (apparently used on Lot's wife when she looked back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah). Dean uses holy fire to trap Balthazar and force him to return Aaron's soul. Castiel releases Balthazar for repaying his rescue and both angels depart with no explanation to the brothers. Later, Dean questions Sam on his recent actions and thinks something's different with him.",

Sam flashes to earlier memories where he is helping Dean and Bobby look for Ellie Visyak, who has been taken by Castiel. They eventually find her but she dies from her wounds while escaping from Crowley. Castiel shows up and breaks the wall in Sam's mind when they refuse to stop trying to stop him. In his mind, Sam fights a ruthless copy of himself (The soulless version from the beginning of the season), eventually winning, and absorbing his memories of the time he was soulless. In the real world, Balthazar betrays Castiel by giving up Crowley's hiding place to Dean and Bobby. Sam travels to Bobby's house in the dream world and meets a third Sam, who consists of the memories when he was in Lucifer's cage. \"Tortured\" Sam allows Sam to kill him, who then reintegrates into Sam's mind. Back in the real world, Castiel discovers Balthazar's treachery and kills him. Dean and Bobby arrive at Crowley's hideout but are attacked by a cloud of demons. Furious, Castiel tries to kill Crowley but discovers that he cannot. Crowley has allied with Raphael as Castiel betrayed him. Giving up Ellie's Purgatory blood, Castiel escapes, while Crowley recites the spell to open Purgatory with Raphael. Dean and Bobby recover and storm in but are both easily beaten by Crowley. As Crowley finishes the spell, nothing happens. Castiel had switched the jars of Purgatory blood, using the real one to open Purgatory and absorb every soul there. Now all powerful, Castiel destroys Raphael, while Crowley escapes. A recovered Sam arrives and stabs Cas with an angel's sword, but it has no effect. Castiel proclaims himself as the new God of the world, and tells the group to bow down and profess their love unto him their Lord or he shall destroy them.",

    "description": "Having gained an incredible increase in power by absorbing the souls of Purgatory (the afterlife of monsters) in the previous season finale, Castiel (Misha Collins) appoints himself the new God and sets out to right some of the wrongs in the world, but is increasingly disturbed by the entities from Purgatory that are proving difficult for him to control. Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki), Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), and Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) enlist the help of the demon Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard) in securing a spell to summon Death (Julian Richings) and bind him to their will so that they can use him to stop Castiel. However, Castiel intervenes and breaks the binding spell. Death decides not to punish Sam, Dean, and Bobby for binding him and instead reveals to the group that the entities Castiel is struggling with are the Leviathans, God's first creations. They had been locked into Purgatory to prevent them from eating the rest of God's creations. After Castiel finds that he has lost control of himself and slaughtered a group of people under the control of the Leviathans, he goes to Sam, Dean, and Bobby for help, and they help him send all the souls he had consumed back into Purgatory. However, the Leviathans remain in Castiel's body and assume complete control, revealing that they have killed him from within. Meanwhile, Sam struggles throughout the episode with psychological fall-out of the \"wall\" in his mind that had been protecting him from his memories of torture at the hands of Lucifer and Michael in Hell, having been torn down by Castiel. Sam begins hallucinating and sees Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino), who tells him that he was never truly saved from Hell; what has transpired since the fifth season finale \"Swan Song\" is all an elaborate illusion controlled by Lucifer designed to psychologically torture Sam by giving him false hope before dashing it.",

During their research, Dean tries a new Turducken burger at a local burger joint, after he and Sam interview the forest ranger, who seems rather unfazed about the recent killings. The three hunters decide to hunt down the creature, coming across the remains of another ranger who went missing recently. Calling in the 1st ranger, he is also taken by the mystery creature; the creature is eventually shot by Bobby. The hunters soon learn that the monster is actually a vicious, hyperadrenalized human-zombie. As they discover this finding, Dean exhibits similar 'stoned' symptoms as the forest ranger had. Eventually, Sam and Bobby realize that the cause behind Dean's mind-dulling (and that of most of the burger joint patrons) is the Turducken sandwich, which ends up secreting a grey substance similar to what was within the hyper-zombie. Following the meat to the supplier, the hunters inadvertently discover the base of operations for the Leviathans. It is discovered that the Leviathan were working on a food additive designed to render humans complacent and mindless, potentially for ease of world domination. However, the leader, Dick, appears and closes the project down because the adverse side effects - zombified humans - made headlines, which is something Dick wants to ensure does not happen to keep humans in the dark about their presence. He also dispatches the lead scientist Leviathan, Dr. Gaines, by placing a bib around his neck, and forces Dr. Gaines to eat himself. Bobby, watching everything, is then attacked by another Leviathan and brought to Dick, who reveals that he plans on eating Bobby in the future, but plans to use him to lure in Sam and Dean.

Eventually, Dean kills the Shōjō, with a blessed (by a procedure carried out at the back of a restaurant), samurai blade. Another important story is that of Bobby's ghost. Bobby has been making his presence felt in the last few episodes, first by dropping the card that led Dean to the hunter who knew Castiel/Emanuel, and from then on helping Dean whenever he gets stuck. For instance, when the Shōjō knocks the blade out of Dean's hand, it immediately glides back into his hand. Sam tells him it's just his mind playing tricks on him, as Sam had done a Ouija Board, and had no response. However, Garth, Dean and Sam both find that whenever an EMF meter is put next to Dean, it lights up. Eventually, when they are about to leave the motel they were staying in, Dean goes back to get Bobby's flask that he left behind. It is then shown that Bobby is present through the flask, but Dean's inability to see him saddens him greatly.",

When they arrive in town, they find out Annie has disappeared. They trace her last whereabouts to an old abandoned house that is haunted by a powerful ghost. Unknown to them, the ghost of Bobby is following them around, having tied himself to his old flask that they carry. He finds the house populated by mostly mindless ghosts and the spirit of Whitman Van Ness. Bobby discovers the ghost of Annie and the two try to solve the murders. They discover that Van Ness murdered all these people and trapped them in the house, but Bobby gets pulled away when the boys leave before he can learn anything else. Having finally learned how to properly use his ghostly abilities from an arrogant ghost named Haskel Crane, Bobby is able to leave Sam and Dean a message that Annie is trapped and that he is still with them. They return to the house where the ghost of a prostitute named Victoria lets them know about Van Ness before he destroys her. Sam and Dean head off to find and destroy Van Ness' bones with the ghost following them after he ties himself to an object he places in Sam's pocket. Bobby and Annie manage to discover the bodies of all the victims and plan to burn them to put the ghosts to rest. However, after Van Ness attacks them, Dean destroys the object and Van Ness returns to his house where he tries to destroy and absorb Bobby. Just in time, Dean burns Van Ness' bones, destroying him. They return to the house where Bobby is now visible to the Winchesters. Bobby leads them to the remains of Van Ness' victims, including Annie, and they burn them, putting them all to rest. Dean, however, is furious that Bobby stayed as it's unnatural and he should've moved on. Bobby, furious, disappears, but listens invisibly in the boys' backseat as they discuss the situation, unsure how to handle it and how it will turn out.",

Tension springs up between the brothers because Sam did not even try to save him, Castiel, or the prophet under their protection, teenager Kevin Tran (Osric Chau) who had been kidnapped a year ago by the demon Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard). When Dean checks Sam's discarded phones, he discovers that Kevin has in fact escaped from Crowley on his own and is now on the run, and he and Sam track him down. Kevin explains that Crowley took him to make him translate the Word of God tablet about demons and help him unleash all demons onto Earth, but that he had managed to escape with the tablet, which he has hidden elsewhere for safe-keeping. He also reveals that the tablet has a way to send all demons to Hell and lock them away forever. The Winchesters immediately want to find the tablet and use the spell to banish the demons, but are interrupted by the arrival of demons who have been following them to find Kevin, including Crowley himself, who is being accompanied by Kevin's possessed girlfriend, Channing Ngo (Lissa Neptuno).

Brian privately realizes that the pure-blood werewolf is one of his professors (David Lewis) and blackmails him into turning him into a werewolf, too.

Unfortunately, it is at that point that Abaddon reveals herself, kills the surviving Man of Letters, and takes Sam hostage, forcing Dean to do a trade: the key and Henry for Sam. After Dean gives Henry and the key to Abaddon, she fatally wounds Henry, but, having planned for this with Dean on their way to the exchange, he shoots her in the head with a bullet engraved with a devil's trap—a symbol that prevents demons from leaving the symbol or using their powers—thus binding her in place and within her body. Dean then decapitates her; unable to kill her, he plans instead to dismember her and bury the pieces to keep her incapacitated indefinitely. Henry dies in his grandsons' arms while making his peace with them. They bury him near his dead friends from the order and contemplate their family's history and how they are now the keepers of the storehouse, if it still exists.",

    "description": "In Belarus, a giant man decimates a Nazi concentration camp while the camp guards desperately try to stop him. The Commandant, Eckhart, casts a spell to escape that burns down the camp and a briefcase the Nazis were trying to protect. In the present, a rabbi, Rabbi Bass (Hal Linden), searches through a college library and finds a book that scares him. He makes a phone call before a mysterious man following him causes him to spontaneously combust. At the same time, Sam and Dean find the abandoned—but still intact—storehouse of the Men of Letters, in Lebanon, Kansas. After two weeks there, Sam discovers the death of Rabbi Bass in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and that he was a member of a secret order of rabbis, called the Judah Initiative, that worked with the Men of Letters during World War II, and they decide to investigate his death. Sam and Dean find themselves followed by the man that decimated the camp, but a young man named Aaron stops him. Aaron is Rabbi Bass' grandson and the last surviving descendant of the Judah Initiative. He was sent the man, a Golem (John DeSantis), after his grandfather died, but lacks the knowledge of how to properly control him. Sam and Dean learn that Rabbi Bass always told tales of battling a society of Nazi necromancers, called the Thule Society, and find the book Rabbi Bass had found and hidden for Aaron. The man who killed Rabbi Bass attacks Sam and Aaron and nearly kills them before the Golem kills him. The group learns the book is the Red Ledger, a logbook of ultimately successful experiments that the Thule performed to learn how to resurrect people. Eckhart and three Thule arrive, disable the Golem, and take back the Ledger. Eckhart reveals to Aaron how to take full control of the Golem, but before he can kill Aaron and the Winchesters, Aaron creates a distraction that allows Sam and Dean to kill two of the Thule. Eckhart then taunts them with the fact that the Thule can't be stopped, and they kill him. After disposing of the Thule bodies, Aaron takes full control of the Golem to continue the fight against the Thule, and Sam and Dean return to the storehouse, where Sam catalogs the Red Ledger, taking on the duties of a Man of Letters.",

    "description": "Sam and Dean have moved into the Men of Letters bunker. After weeks of work, Kevin finally cracks the instructions on how to close the Gates of Hell and calls Sam and Dean. Kevin states that in order to close the gates, someone must complete three trials. The first trial is to kill a hellhound, bathe in its blood, and recite a spell. The same spell is recited after the completion of each trial. Deciding to track down a hellhound, Sam identifies the Cassity family in Shoshone, Idaho, who, ten years ago, struck oil where there should be none, indicating they made a deal with a Crossroads Demon. At the Cassity farm, Sam and Dean take jobs, while keeping an eye on the family, with the intent of killing the hellhound sent to collect the person's soul. Believing it to be the owner, Alice, Sam and Dean miss the hellhound, who kills Alice's husband, Carl, who they learn made a deal with a demon to get Alice to fall in love with him. Realizing that there is still someone else who made a crossroads deal, Sam and Dean remain so that they don't have to start over. Kevin calls and tells them that only the damned, or an item scorched by holy fire, can see a hellhound, leading Dean to find glasses he can wave in a fire made with holy oil. The whole Cassity family arrives to comfort Alice. While Dean tries to find the hellhound, Sam focuses on finding which one of the bickering family members made the deal. Along the way, Sam learns that the deal was made with Crowley himself. Eventually, while trying to hunt what she believes is a wolf that killed Carl, Margot, the youngest family member, is killed by the hellhound, and it is discovered that she believed her family would be happy if they struck oil. The hellhound continues to hunt around the house, indicating that someone else made a deal, as well. Dean learns that the ranch manager Ellie (Danay García) made a deal to save her mother from Parkinson's disease when she was 15. Dean battles the hellhound when it goes after Ellie, but when he fails, Sam kills it and is coated in its blood, making him the one to complete the trials. Sam and Dean give Ellie a hexbag and send her on the run from Crowley, believing that if she keeps hidden, Crowley won't be able to send another hellhound to kill her. After convincing Dean that there is hope for life to continue after Hell is closed, instead of it being a suicide mission like he believes, Sam casts the spell needed to start closing the gates.",

Traveling to St. Louis, Missouri, they learn that James has become a witch since they last met and is using magic to solve cases as a police officer. Sam and Dean are unhappy due to their previous encounters with witches, but decide to give him a chance. James' familiar, Portia (portrayed by Mishael Morgan) approaches the Winchesters, revealing that she sent the text, and stating that James is having dreams of killing people who, in reality, are actually dying. Though Dean wants to kill James, Sam convinces him to investigate first, convinced that someone might be committing the murders and placing the memories in James' mind. Sam and Dean chain James down, but while having sex with Portia, who he is in a relationship with, James opens his mind to her. Portia sees his dreams and realizes that all he is seeing are the murders, with no intent or planning to it, and convinces Sam and Dean that James must be innocent. Dean finds a spell in Bobby's notes that a witch could be using to implant false memories in James' mind. Realizing that the police detective investigating the case, Ed Stoltz, is hiding something, Sam, Dean, and James use astral projection to visit the station and discover that Stoltz, who has a grudge against James, is building a case against him using the familiar of another witch as a witness. James questions the familiar, who admits that he was doing so on his master, Spencer's, orders. Spencer kills his familiar and reveals he was jealous of James and Portia, wanting her as his familiar and lover. James battles Spencer to no avail, but when Portia creates a distraction, Sam and Dean kill Spencer with a witch-killing spell from Bobby's notes. James and Portia decide to leave town and start a new life together, rather than fight the case building against him. Dean finally decides to trust Sam's judgment, realizing that Sam can handle the trials after being reminded how important family is due to a psychic attack Spencer inflicted on Sam.

Sam learns that Dean (Dylan Everett in flashbacks) spent two months at the school in 1995 after he got caught stealing food. Instead of it being a hard time for Dean, he enjoyed it and flourished, along the way having his first romance with a girl named Robin (Sarah Desjardins). On the night of a school dance, Dean's father returned to collect him and, despite Sonny's offer to let him stay permanently, Dean elects to leave to reunite with Sam (Hunter Dillon in flashbacks).

They eventually patch things up. Sam and Dean go to the reform school, where they talk with a boy named Timmy (Sean Michael Kyer), whose mother is a ghost who has been protecting him from perceived threats at the cost of going murderously insane from being tied to Earth.

Sam and Dean realize that the victims all belong to the same church chastity group and so go undercover as new members to continue investigating. Dean discovers that the group councilor, Suzy Lee (Susie Abromeit), is one of his favorite porn stars; unhappy with her old life, she has quit the porn industry and is trying to turn over a new leaf. Wooing her with his genuine admiration for her and her work, he seduces her at the same time that Sam and Sheriff Mills realize that the people taken are members of the chastity group who have broken their vows of chastity. Before Sam and Sheriff Mills can get to them, Dean and Suzy are kidnapped and imprisoned in an old fallout shelter where the rest of the victims are being kept (save one who has already been taken away). Dean manages to call Sam and though the call cuts out quickly, the sound of a train whistle in the background clues Sam and Sheriff Mills in to Dean's location. They also deduce that they are dealing with the goddess Vesta (Lindy Booth), who has been posing as a member of the chastity group to select her victims. Sheriff Mills manages to kill Vesta and she, Sam, and Dean (who breaks free of confinement) rescue the surviving victims. However, Sam remains troubled by Vesta's words about him barely being kept alive. Seeing his brother's distress, Dean is about to tell him the truth, but Ezekiel reemerges and warns him not to.",

Sam and Dean initially investigate with Castiel, but Ezekiel makes Dean send Castiel away. Desperate, Castiel prays for help and is met by an angel named Muriel who is neutral in the war. Castiel convinces her to hear him out and she explains what she knows, but he is captured by Malachi and another angel named Theo who were tracking Muriel. Malachi tortures Castiel for information on Metatron, killing Muriel to try to force him to tell him what he knows. He reveals that many angels died in the Fall from Heaven, including Ezekiel. Malachi leaves Castiel alone with Theo who wants to defect to Metatron's side. Castiel tricks Theo into releasing him, then steals his grace, turning him back into an angel and at least partially restoring his powers. After escaping, Castiel calls Dean to warn him about \"Ezekiel.\" At the same time, Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) meets with \"Ezekiel,\" who is revealed to actually be Gadreel, the appointed guardian of the Garden of Eden until he let Lucifer in and fell into disgrace in the eyes of the Heavenly Host. He was imprisoned in Heaven's dungeon for not stopping Lucifer and was only released by the Fall. Metatron, having grown bored with his solitary rule of Heaven, proposes working together to restore Heaven with angels that they like. Gadreel is initially reluctant, but agrees and is given orders by Metatron to kill Kevin to prove his allegiance. After learning the truth from Castiel, Dean uses a sigil to knock Gadreel out so that he can tell Sam the truth, but \"Sam\" knocks him out and reveals himself to really be Gadreel, having altered the sigil so it gave him control rather than Sam. Gadreel kills Kevin and leaves, taking with him the angel and demon tablets, but leaves Dean alive to mourn the loss of Kevin and Sam.",

Following clues, Dean and Crowley discover that Dean's father had once worked with a hunter named Tara who spent years searching for the Blade. Finding Tara, they cast a locator spell she found that leads them to the \"retired\" demon Cain (Timothy Omundson), who had trained—and then killed—all the other Knights of Hell except Abaddon, who had escaped his wrath. Cain refuses to help them, even letting in a group of other demons to fight Dean and Crowley, who kill them. Cain reveals that he wants revenge on Abaddon, as she murdered his wife, but is unable to exact it himself because he is bound by his promise to his wife not to kill anymore. Cain also reveals that the spell led them to him because his Mark (the brand Lucifer marked him with when he turned him into a demon) is the source of the Blade's power and he can transfer it to someone worthy. Despite Cain's warnings of an unknown but terrible cost, Dean agrees to bear the Mark so that he can kill Abaddon. Cain asks for Dean to kill him after killing Abaddon and sends him and Crowley to safety as he single-handedly defeats a swarm of demons that arrived to kill them. Having picked up on Crowley giving himself away in small but tell-tale ways, Dean confronts Crowley on having been deceiving and manipulating him all along, including having allowed Tara to be questioned, tortured, and killed by demons so that they would find him and Dean and Dean could prove himself worthy to Cain for the Mark. However, Dean can't retaliate against Crowley yet because he still needs Crowley to retrieve the First Blade from the bottom of the ocean. Running parallel to this plot is Sam and Castiel's attempts to harvest the part of Gadreel's grace that is still inside Sam so that they can use it to track the angel. Removing the grace causes Sam to start reverting into the state he was before Gadreel possessed him, but Sam refuses to let him stop until they get all the grace they need, even if it means his death. Due to his own brief humanity, Castiel empathizes with Sam's desire to make up for the people who've died from the choices he, Sam, and Dean have made, but refuses to risk killing Sam, instead stopping and finishing healing Sam and eliminating the last of the grace. The spell turns out to be unsuccessful because they didn't get enough grace. Castiel leaves to track Metatron, who he believes holds the key to fixing everything.",

Investigating, they find Kate, the werewolf they let go two years previously, and believe her to be the killer. As they prepare to kill her, they get a call that there is another murder that Kate couldn't have committed, meaning there is another werewolf responsible.

Unlike Kate, Tasha has embraced her monstrous instincts and started killing. Dean tricks Kate into leading them to her sister, but Tasha reveals that she now has a \"pack\" consisting of two men she has turned, and has the boys captured.

Meanwhile, Dean tracks the Stynes to Shreveport, Louisiana, where he is arrested by the corrupt police before forcing the sheriff to tell him where to find the Stynes. Dean is captured when attacking their mansion and they prepare to dissect him, but he escapes and brutally slaughters the assembled family members. When he returns to the bunker, he finds the last three Stynes robbing it, and kills all three despite the youngest Styne's pleas for mercy. Castiel remonstrates with Dean, but Dean beats him savagely and comes close to killing him with an angel blade. Before leaving, he warns Castiel that he will kill him and Sam if he should see them again.",

Realizing he's gone too far, Dean summons Death (Julian Richings) to kill him before he hurts anyone else. Death explains that the Mark is the lock on the prison of an ancient evil called the Darkness and if the Mark is removed without being passed on, the Darkness will be released. He agrees to transport Dean far away in exchange for him killing Sam so Sam won't try to rescue him. Dean calls Sam and explains that he feels that they are evil and ridding the world of both of them is for the greater good.

Meanwhile, the Winchesters investigate a murder-suicide and soon learn it is a stronger version of the infection fog that is making the townspeople go mad. Chuck reveals he's been traveling the world and only wants to talk about things he's done as a human. Metatron's criticism of Chuck's writing gets him to reveal he has some sympathy for Lucifer turning into a villain because of the Mark of Cain and the burden of containing Amara. He likes the Winchesters and constantly brought back Castiel for them, but their quest to destroy the Mark is what freed Amara, so he is done helping them. Since God is Being while Amara is Nothingness, Chuck became lonely and thought by creating things he could convince Amara to be better, but she just destroyed everything. After barely locking her away and seeing all the conflict both humans and angels create, Chuck walked away, letting them sort it out for themselves and sees no point in fighting Amara again. Metatron is disgusted that Chuck has become a coward. While humans may have flaws, they also create beauty, art and love; they are God's greatest creations because they never give up.

While they are gone, Ketch leads a team that checks out the Bunker and leaves spy equipment behind to watch the Winchesters. The Winchesters discover that every year from 1898 to 1997, someone disappeared in Tomahawk and suspect a satyr due to a witness description of the monster. After the witness disappears, the Winchesters suspect the local sheriff, Barrett Bishop whose family owned the town until he recently sold most everything. Confronting Barrett, the Winchesters learn that his family got their riches by sacrificing people to the god Moloch. After Barrett's father died in 1997, Barrett put an end to it and left Moloch to starve to death as he had no desire to harm anyone. However, Moloch was rediscovered recently by Barrett's half-brother Pete who was promised riches in exchange for feeding Moloch. After Pete kidnaps Dean and tries to feed him to Moloch, Sam kills Pete and then Moloch with a shot from the Colt. Afterwards, the Winchesters ponder their legacy on the world and carve their initials in the library table at the Bunker.
