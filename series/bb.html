In the passenger seat, another man is passed out, also wearing a gas mask, his head on the dashboard. Two bodies slide across the RV floor until the vehicle veers into a ditch. The hyperventilating driver, Walter White, climbs out, dons the shirt still hanging off the side view mirror (his pants are long since gone), then re-enters the van to retrieve a video camera, his wallet, and a gun. He records a cryptic, handheld farewell to his wife and son as sirens can be heard in the distance. He then places the camera alongside his wallet, walks onto the road, and awaits the approach of the emergency services, gun in hand.</p></div></div>

He looks at himself in the mirror.<br><br>Twelve hours before, a Native American man tows their RV from a ditch, a pants-less Walt and a black-eyed Jesse Pinkman thank him profusely and hand him a wad of cash. As Walt attempts to get the RV started, they argue, with Jesse's reluctance, to park the RV at Jesse's house and part ways for the time being. We see that Walt's gas mask is being forgotten, still behind a rock at the crash site. They agree that this partnership will end as soon as they deal with the bodies of Emilio Koyama and Krazy-8 lying in the back. As Walt turns the key in the ignition, finally getting the engine to turn over, a sound alerts them to the fact that one of the "dead" men isn't dead.</p></div></div>

The grisly scene at Jesse's house takes Walt back to his younger days. In a flashback, he is seen in a laboratory with a female lab partner and they are analyzing the human body's chemical composition. After discovering that only 99 percent of the body's makeup is accounted for chemically, Walt muses that there has to be more to a human being than that. Back in the present Walt's older self flushes another bloody bucketful down the toilet.</p></div></div>

As far as customers, Walt wants nothing to do with them "No more bloodshed." This scene is intercut with shots of a bald man calmly walking through a group of bikers on a street littered with smoldering debris, various car alarms blaring. He is holding a white bag with a red stain on it. As we pan up and his face is revealed, we see that this bald man is actually Walt and we are in a flashforward.</p></div></div>

However, later in the parking lot, the two have sex in Walt's car. "Where did that come from?" she asks. "And why was it so damn good?" "Because it was illegal," Walt replies.</p></div></div>

A figure in a hazmat suit leans over into the pool and spots the teddy bear, then retrieves it with a pool skimmer. Placing it into an evidence bag, they lay the teddy bear on the ground next to other collected objects, also wrapped in evidence bags, carefully organized along the side of the pool. The line of random objects ends with a pair of eyeglasses, very reminiscent of Walter White's.</p></div></div>

Badger almost immediately laughs him off, convinced that the guy has to be an undercover cop: he even points out the multiple vans "inconspicuously" parked nearby and guesses that they're surveillance vehicles. The customer, somewhat annoyed with Badger's behavior, lifts his shirt to show that he's not wearing a wire as Badger suspects, and almost starts to walk away before Badger apologizes. Still, Badger explains that he can't sell to the guy, because there's no way to be sure that he isn't a cop. So the customer explains that a cop can't deny that he's a cop if you ask him directly, saying "it's in the Constitution". Delighted, Badger asks him if he's a cop.

Near by, a young boy, Tomás Cantillo, is riding his bike. A car pulls up and Combo crosses the street to meet the two men inside.<br><br>When the two men don't respond, Combo raises his shirt and shows them the silver pistol in his waistband. The two men pull off. Combo returns back to the corner as the two men in the car then circle the block. They begin watching him as they sit at the intersection. Nervous, Combo calls Skinny Pete, telling him that he's "gettin' eyeballed hard" and may need backup. While he talks, Tomas circles him while riding his bike. Moments later, the driver honks the horn to his car. A split second later, Tomas produces a pistol and shoots Combo in the chest. The two of them both share terrified expressions. Tomas hesitates for a second, but then shoots Combo again. Combo drops his drink and tries to run away, yet he only makes it to the middle of the street before Tomas finishes him off. Tomas and the two dealers then flee the scene as Combo bleeds to death.<br><br><br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7780017780012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7780017780012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In a flashback, Gale Boetticher excitedly unpacks sterling new high-tech lab equipment, making notes in a distinctive journal labeled "Lab Notes" - he is setting up the superlab. Gustavo Fring visits Gale in the lab to check on his process. Gale then praises the blue meth Gus gave him to analyze — it's beyond the purity that he, or anyone else he knows of, could produce - a 96% to 99% purity difference, which doesn't seem much but is in fact quite major. Gus politely demurs, saying the chemist responsible wouldn't make a suitable partner due to other considerations. Gale insists on the superiority of this blue meth — he says that they "have their work cut out for them" if that is their competition, and he knows the value Gus puts on perfection. Gus reconsiders; it seems Gale has just talked Gus into hiring Walter White.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Gale's corpse   <br><br>Back in the present, Jesse Pinkman stands in Gale's doorway, having just shot him. Jesse is in a state of shock, with red flooded eyes, he can hardly flee when he does. Moments later, Victor pushes his way through a small group of neighbors, including one on the phone to 911, and finds Gale dead, shot through the eye. Outside, Victor spots a shell-shocked Jesse in his car. Victor jumps in and orders Jesse to drive at gunpoint.<br><br>At the lab, Walt and Mike Ehrmantraut stare each other down, Walt fearing for his life. Victor returns with Jesse and for a moment Walt thinks Jesse failed and it's possibly the end for them both. But on seeing the state of Jesse Walt realizes he must've triumphed, he breathes again. To Mike it's clear he failed; Gale is dead. He's not looking forward to calling the boss. <br><br>Mike asks if Victor performed a sweep of Gale's apartment. Victor replies that he couldn't because people were already there. When Mike asks if he was seen, he admits he was, but is certain they mistook him for "just another looky-Lou."<br><br>Early the next morning, Marie Schrader appears at Skyler White's house with a stack of unpaid medical bills. Seeing Walt's car, she assumes Walt and Skyler have reunited. After Marie leaves, Skyler moves Walt's car to a nearby street so Walter, Jr. won't ask questions when he wakes up.<br><br>Back at the lab, Walt explains the new reality to Mike and Victor: like it or not, he's the only one who can maintain the meth production schedule. In response, Victor switches on the equipment. "We ain't missin' no cook," he says defiantly. Now Walt and Jesse have a new problem - if Victor can manage a cook by himself.<br><br>Saul Goodman, frantically scouring every inch of his office for bugs, receives a call from Skyler asking where Walt is. Returning her call by payphone, Saul lies and assures her Walt is fine; then he tells his new bodyguard, Huell Babineaux, that they might need to leave town.<br><br>Skyler drives with Holly to Walt's apartment. When no one answers the door, she convinces a locksmith, Adam, to break the law and let her inside by feigning a panic attack, which she does perfectly convincingly. (Skyler is fast becoming quite the expert deceiver.) Searching the apartment, she finds no clues to Walt's whereabouts.<br><br>Meanwhile, Marie gushes about Hank's progress in physical therapy. Hank dismisses the compliment; she's exaggerating, since he only covered sixteen feet in twenty minutes. Humiliated and defeated, he asks Marie to help him use his bedpan.<br><br>At the lab, Jesse remains nearly catatonic while Walt waits and hopes for Victor to miss a step in the cook. He doesn't. Gus arrives and Walt immediately tries to defend his and Jesse's actions. Gus wordlessly changes into one of the lab's orange clean-up suits. As he becomes more nervous and agitated, Walt blames Gus for Gale's death: did Gus really think that Walt wouldn't take "extreme measures" to defend himself? Gus says nothing and Walt, panic mounting, taunts Victor with rapid-fire questions pertaining to the chemistry of the meth-making process, attempting to convince all that he and Jesse are indeed still needed.<br><br>It's called "a cook" for a reason, counters Victor, you follow a recipe. And he's sure he knows the recipe as he's memorised all the steps. But Victor doesn't know the chemistry and can't fix problems that might arise, Walt challenges. Without him and Jesse, says Walt, the lab is just "an eight million dollar hole in the ground."<br><br>Gus picks up a box-cutter and walks menacingly toward Walt and Jesse. "You kill me," says Walt, "you have nothing. You kill Jesse, you don't have me."<br><br><br><br>         Gus slicing Victor's throat with a box cutter   <br><br>Gus crosses over to Victor, and continues staring at Walt and Jesse as Walt begs him to forget everything and let them get back to work. Suddenly, Gus grabs Victor and slashes his carotid artery with the box cutter. Victor struggles, but Gus pulls Victor's head back ensuring that the blood from the wound sprays on a shocked Jesse and Walt. Mike, dumbfounded, watches as his partner bleeds out and begins moving less and less. Walt can hardly meet Gus' icy stare. Jesse, grinding his teeth, locks eyes with Gus until, his face covered in blood, Gus pushes Victor's dead body to the floor. He walks past Walt and Jesse, dropping the box cutter. After calmly washing all the blood off his face, Gus silently changes back into his street clothes and walks out of the lab.<br><br>At the door, he turns and looks over the rail at Walk and Jesse. "Well?" he says. "Get back to work."<br><br>As Mike watches, Walt and Jesse squeeze Victor's body into a plastic drum then pour in hydrofluoric acid. "You sure it'll do the job?" Mike asks. "Trust us," Jesse replies. Walt seals the drum, which is shipped off with a load of hazardous material.<br><br>Later at a diner, Jesse eats ravenously, while Walt appears shaken. Walt asks Jesse what their next move should be, "given the fact that at his first opportunity Gus will kill us." Jesse disagrees; if Gus wanted them dead, he would've done it at the superlab. Walt replies that they merely bought time until Gus finds another chemist.<br><br>"Good luck with that," laughs Jesse, eerily unaffected, adding that everyone is on the same page now: "The one that says if I can't kill you, you'll sure as shit wish you were dead."<br><br>Walt arrives at Skyler's house in a cab but can't find his car. Skyler meets him in the driveway and tells him she moved it to avoid questions from Walter, Jr. She does not ask him where he's been, she simply directs Walt to his car and returns to the house. Walt smiles, and seems optimistic that he's making some headway with Skyler.<br><br>At Gale's, Albuquerque PD processes the scene. Gale's "Lab Notes" journal sits in plain sight on his coffee table.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>Skyler finds the Teddy Bear eye from Seasons 2-3 <br><br> A bedridden Hank is shown bidding on a magnesite crystal on a fictional auction site called "MineralEmporium.com". The url displayed in the browser is actually a local file on Hank's laptop: "C:\Users\Mad Props\Desktop\Mineral Emporium screen\ebay hero.html". MineralEmporium.com in fact redirects to www.breakingbad-tv.com/ and that redirects finally to www.sonypictures.com/tv/breakingbad/.[1]<br><br>The box cutter Gus uses to kill Victor is presumably the same one used by Gale to cut open the boxes containing the equipment at the beginning of the episode. It's later use is foreshadowed in the earlier scene, and is an example of Chekhov's Gun.[2]<br><br>The production designer says he and Gilligan chose the type of box cutter on purpose: the green color was easy to see on the red floor.<br><br>The box cutter model used in episode is the RSG-383 QuickBlade Safety Grip by Pacific Handy Cutter, Inc.[3]<br><br><br><br>Gus's actions towards Victor in this episode contradict his previous statement in "Green Light" about fear not being an effective motivator.<br><br>During a scene when Gale's neighbor calls police to report his murder, a clock in Gale's apartment reads 10:13. This is a deliberate reference to the number 1013, which frequently appeared in The X-Files, where Vince Gilligan worked as a writer and producer. It refers to the October 13 birthday of X-Files creator Chris Carter. See references to The X-Files.<br><br>Gale's apartment contains several Persian rugs similar to the rugs used in the film The Big Lebowski (1998).  The Dude's original rug was soiled by urine.  Gale's rug is soiled by his own blood.  <br><br>The scene in the diner is clearly an homage to a similar scene in Pulp Fiction (1994).  Vincent and Jules share breakfast after cleaning up Marvin's murder with assistance from The Wolf. Vincent and Jules are uncharacteristically wearing T-shirts because their clothes were covered in blood.   <br><br>During this scene Walt and Jesse are wearing matching T-shirts with country music singer Kenny Rogers on them. The T-shirts are deliberately not explained in the episode, but Vince Gilligan said he believed Mike simply bought the first articles of clean clothing he could find for Walter and Jesse after their clothes were soaked with Victor's blood.<br><br>Walter's still retains the sticker with the shirt size - "Large".   <br><br>The T-shirts displaying Kenny Rogers could also be a reference to his most well-known song, 'The Gambler', which would be associated with Walt's gambling story or the risk Walt took in choosing to kill Gale.  Rogers other well-known hits "She Believes In Me," "Coward of the County," "Islands in the Stream," "We've Got Tonight," and "Lucille" also offer ironic interpretations for this episode.  Rogers also sang "Just Dropped In" with First Edition, a song about coming off of a drug-induced high used in the film The Big Lebowski.  <br><br><br><br>When Mike asks if the hydrofluoric acid will work, Jesse says, "Trust us," referring to their use of hydrofluoric acid to dissolve Emilio Koyama's body in "Cat's in the Bag...".<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br>David Costabile as Gale Boetticher<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jeremiah Bitsui as Victor<br><br>Lavell Crawford as Huell<br><br>Tina Parker as Francesca<br><br><br><br><br><br>John Lawlor as Locksmith<br><br>John Barbour as Neighbor<br><br>Victoria Aultman as Waitress<br><br><br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Rodger Larance as Cab Driver<br><br><br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br>"Bringing It Back" by Tee-Double (playing in Walt Jr's room in the morning)<br><br>"Eyeball in the Drawer" by Dave Porter (while Skyler snoops around the Beachcomber)<br><br>"I Don't Mind" by Jamie Dunlap, Scott Nickoley, and Stephen Lang (in the diner while Jesse eats)<br><br>"Unknown Track #1" by Unknown Artist (in the diner while Jesse eats)<br><br>"Truth" by Alexander Ebert (as Walt walks to get his car and the police examine Gale's apartment)<br><br><br><br>Memorable Quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Alright, let's talk about Gale Boetticher.

When you make it Gale versus me, or Gale versus Jesse, Gale loses! Simple as that. This is on you, Gus, not me, not Jesse. I mean really, what'd you expect me to do? Just simply roll over and allow you to murder us? That I wouldn't take measures – extreme measures – to defend myself? Wrong!

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In a motel room, Walter White purchases a thirty-eight snub with a filed off serial number from Lawson, an illicit gun dealer procured by Saul. Watching Walt awkwardly draw the weapon, Lawson advises Walt to keep practising his draw. He tells Walt that as long as this gun is for defense, there is little sense in him carrying an illegal firearm. But Walt says he wants it this way "just in case" — from the look on his face it's clear 'legal' isn't what he's looking for.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Having coffee at a bar, Mike Ehrmantraut discovers Victor's dried blood on his jacket sleeve. He wipes it off, unsettled.<br><br>Jesse Pinkman shows off his powerful new sound system to Badger and Skinny Pete. He then tempts his friends — who are in recovery, "12 steps and all" — with coke. Badger and Skinny Pete quickly cave, get high and discuss the finer points of video game zombies. Jesse decides to throw a party and the house quickly fills with dozens of people drinking and dancing.<br><br>At his condo, Walt practices drawing the revolver; he's getting better and better.<br><br>Marie Schrader wakes in the middle of the night to find Hank Schrader examining his minerals. When she mentions how late it is, he pointedly notes that the house has other bedrooms.<br><br>The next morning, Walt chastises Skyler White for discussing their intention to buy a car wash over the phone. They're not talking about purchasing a brothel, she counters, adding that if Walt isn't "willing to pull the trigger" on the deal then she'll contact Saul Goodman directly. That gets Walt's attention — he can't let that happen — and they start to talk it over.<br><br>Jesse, meanwhile, tiptoes through the passed-out partygoers. Peeling off some large bills, Jesse instructs Badger to buy everyone breakfast and keep the party going until he returns.<br><br>At the lab, Walt tucks his gun in his belt, waiting for Gustavo Fring to arrive. When someone enters the laboratory and appears at the top of the stairs, Walt prepares to draw. Only instead of Gus, who arrives is actually Victor's replacement, Tyrus Kitt, there to pick up the latest batch. When Mike demands a second weighing ("new policy") Walt asks to see Gus to "clear the air." "You're never gonna see him again," Mike replies.<br><br>Surveilling the car wash from across the street, Skyler tallies the cars and services each customer receives, making a detailed accounting of the business.<br><br>At the Schrader house, Hank pushes himself to "soldier up" through a tough physical therapy session. Marie is elated by Hank's progress, but after the therapist departs, Hank coldly orders her out of the room.<br><br>The party is in full swing at Jesse's house when he returns from the lab. Andrea rings the doorbell, but waits outside to speak with him. She asks Jesse if he sent her an envelope of cash the night her brother's killers were murdered. Jesse acknowledges he did, then urges her to use the money to move her son Brock to a better neighborhood.<br><br>Late that night, Walt approaches Gus's house, gun in hand, but loses his nerve when Tyrus calls, telling him, "Go home, Walter." Surprised, he looks all around but sees nothing. But, it seems his every move is being watched.<br><br>The next day, a deliveryman arrives at the Schrader home with box upon box of minerals. Hank instructs Marie to check each box for damage. "They're rocks," she replies, bristling. He corrects her, "they're minerals," and some of them are very delicate. Once again, Hank treats her unkindly and Marie feels it acutely.<br><br>At the car wash, Skyler approaches Bogdan Wolynetz with a proposal to buy his business. He derisively asks for $10 million; Skyler counters with $879,000 then shows him detailed research of his expenses and revenues. $20 million, Bogdan replies. "This is the price for Walter White," he says, because Walt insulted him by quitting, grabbing his crotch, and "sending his woman" to make the offer instead of coming himself. This last accusation clearly angers Skyler, who walks out in a huff.<br><br>Walt approaches Mike at a bar and tells him that his recent actions were motivated by loyalty to Jesse and self-defense. Walt says that he believes that Mike was just following orders when he tried to kill him. "There's a load off my mind," Mike drily replies. "So, what's with the piece?" Mike asks: he noticed Walt's gun at the lab.<br><br>Walt insists that he and Mike are in "the same boat," and that Gus could easily kill either of them. "Get me in a room with him," Walt says, "and I'll do the rest." Mike seems to consider the suggestion for a moment, then knocks Walt to the floor with a savage punch, and kicks him twice in the gut when he's down. Walt has his answer; Mike is not an ally here.<br><br>As Jesse's party finally breaks up, he asks Badger and Skinny Pete to stick around. Badger and Skinny Pete apologetically decline, disappointing a depressed Jesse who's desperate for the distraction. Alone in his house for the first time in days, Jesse cranks up the music to earsplitting levels, and sits against the shaking speaker, shaking. With fingers digging into his temples, Jesse starts to panic at being left with only the scary dark depths of his mind and his demons for company.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>Uncensored on home video. Some of the music featured during Jesse's party has some strong language. In the edited version, this language was muted.<br><br>The subtitles on TV commercial of Saul Goodman says: 'Settlement figures quoted are for illustration purposes only... Does not constitute a promise of results... Amounts referenced are before fees and expenses... Every case is different and must be judged on its own merits...'<br><br>The scene where Jesse, Badger, and Skinny Pete discuss why the pizza place (Venezia's Pizzeria) does not slice their own pizza comes from the scene in the episode "Caballo Sin Nombre" of season 3, where Walter throws a pizza onto the roof of his house, also unsliced. This caused a fan discussion of why the pizza was not sliced.<br><br> The title "Thirty-Eight Snub" refers not only to the type of gun Walter buys, but also to the various characters being snubbed throughout the episode. Gus snubs Walter when Mike says Walter will never see Gus again. The car wash owner Bogdan Wolynetz snubs Skyler when she asks to buy the carwash. Mike snubs Walter when Walter asks him at the bar to get him alone in a room with Gus. Hank snubs Marie during his treatment. And finally, Badger and Skinny Pete snub Jesse when they leave the house at the end of the episode refusing to party any longer.<br><br> Combinations of 3's and 8's occur often in Breaking Bad. The White residence is 308 Negro Arroyo Lane. In "4 days out" they cook 38 pounds of Meth, which they eventually end up selling to Gus in the episode "ABQ". In the episode "One Minute", the time on the clock is 3:07 when there is one minute left, and it then turns to 3:08 when the minute is up. And here in this episode Walt buys a 38 snub nose.<br><br> This is the first appearance of Lawson.<br><br> The scene in which Walter practices drawing his gun uses camera angles similar to the opening scene of the "Pilot".<br><br> When Jesse yells "Wake up and party!" the morning after the party at his house, the guest waking up in the frame is Bryan Cranston with a wig and different glasses.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring (credit only)<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br>Jim Beaver as Lawson<br><br>Matt Jones as Badger<br><br>Emily Rios as Andrea Cantillo<br><br>Charles Baker as Skinny Pete<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Marius Stan as Bogdan<br><br>Ray Campbell as Tyrus<br><br>Tank Jones as Chuck<br><br>Ian Posada as Brock<br><br><br><br><br><br>John Christopher Hicks as Biker<br><br>Jefferson Arca as Delivery Man<br><br>Sarah Minnich as Party Girl<br><br>David Robinson as Commercial Voice Over<br><br><br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Martin Palmer as CarWash Patron<br><br><br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br>"Money" by D/R Period (feat.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Walter White arrives at the superlab and hears the whirring sound of a surveillance camera tracking his every move: Gustavo Fring is watching him. Furious, he flips the bird to the camera.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Skyler White, frustrated because Walt won't return her calls, visits his apartment to discuss the car wash; Walt growls that he's facing far more pressing matters. Noticing the bruise on Walt's face from Mike Ehrmantraut's beating, Skyler tells Walt to go to the police, admit his crimes and tell them he fears for his life. That's the last thing Walt wants to do. At being pressed for details, Walt admits he got into a minor disagreement with a colleague over a 'business strategy', but the issue is resolved. Case closed: no police for Walt. Period. Skyler can hardly believe Walt's been in a "bar fight", then makes him promise she'll be informed if he's ever in danger. <br><br>Marie Schrader attends a residential open house, posing as a recently divorced woman with a gifted son that she wants to home school, apparently up to something.<br><br>Hank Schrader is watching softcore porn when Marie comes home. He quickly shuts off the television while Marie unpacks her shopping, along with a figurine she stole from the open house, hinting the resurface of her kleptomania.<br><br>At the lab, Walt grumbles about the surveillance camera to Jesse Pinkman, who shrugs it off; doesn't seem like that big a deal to him as they suspected it was bugged before anyway. He asks if Walt would like to race go-karts with him after work. Walt, confused and disinterested says he has other plans, then asks Jesse how he's doing and if there's anything he should know. Without answering, Jesse points to Walt's bruised eye and asks Walt the same.<br><br>At the condo with Walt and Skyler, Saul Goodman touts the Zen Nail Spa as the best way to launder money. "Ya bombed. It happens," Saul says about Skyler's attempt to purchase the car wash. Bogdan Wolynetz just needs an "attitude adjustment," contends Skyler, though she rules out instigating an IRS audit, INS raid or any violence.<br><br>Walt thinks the car wash is a bad idea. That is, until Skyler manipulates him by mentioning Bogdan's affronts to Walt's manhood. Now, Walt's on board and insists they buy the business.<br><br>Marie visits another open house and admires the owner's collection of spoons, describing herself to the agent as the childless wife of a retired astronaut. After the open house, the agent notices the spoon Marie remarked about is missing.<br><br>That evening, Jesse races go-karts alone, shouting at the top of his lungs (a touch of 'scream therapy') as he takes a curve. He arrives home to a meth party that's spiraling out of control, with people fighting, having rough sex and vandalizing the house. Jesse sits down, lights a cigarette, and impassively watches the chaos.<br><br>Marie attends another open house, this time presenting herself to its owners as the globetrotting wife of an illustrator, but she exits swiftly after the agent from the previous house recognizes her. Outside, the agent accuses her of stealing and they tussle over Marie's purse. It falls to the ground, revealing a picture frame Marie lifted from inside, with the photo of the couple as irrefutable proof of her theft. <br><br>Hank, in bed, takes a phone call from Marie, from the police station. "Are you seriously doing this to me again?" Hank snarls, instructing her to sit tight while he makes a call.<br><br>At the police station, Hank's colleague Sgt. Tim Roberts tells Marie that the homeowners are not pressing charges. When he asks if she wants to go home, Marie starts sobbing, unable to speak.<br><br>While surrounded by the suds from Holly's baby bottles, Skyler is struck by an idea and calls Saul.<br><br>On Walt and Skyler's orders, Saul sends a henchman named Patrick Kuby to the car wash, wearing a Bluetooth headset to pose as an environmental inspector. Kuby shows water samples to Bogdan and declares they're full of contaminants. Bogdan must replace his entire wastewater treatment system, and the state requires he cease operations until it's back up to code, Kuby says. Then we see that Skyler is feeding Kuby lines via her cell phone — this is her big idea, but it's not clear if the very frustrated Bogdan is biting.<br><br>Tim visits Hank to solicit his help — as "a pal I just did a favor for" — in solving the Gale Boetticher murder. Showing Hank a copy of Gale's lab notebook, Tim speculates that it "pertains to some kind of methamphetamine superlab." Hank dismisses Tim's overture as "some sort of a charity thing," but halfheartedly agrees to review the notebook. He dismissively sets it on a pile of his minerals.<br><br>At Skyler's house, after the phony environmental inspection, Walt and Skyler wait on word from Bogdan. Walt believes the scheme has failed, but Skyler refuses to concede. The phone rings — it's Bogdan calling with an offer to sell the car wash for $879,000. Skyler reduces her offer to $800,000, ignoring Walt's protests and hanging up when Bogdan balks. Walt thinks she's pushed it too far, Skyler disagrees. A few moments later, just as Skyler is fearing Walt is proven right, Bogdan calls back, and Skyler smiles with a hint of success.<br><br>In his living room, Jesse balls up fifty-dollar bills and tosses them at the open mouth of a pants-less party guest passed out on the floor. "Yeah, bitch!" exclaims Jesse when he finally makes a shot, but no one reacts. Trying to breathe some life into the very unsavory and lethargic crowd, Jesse tosses his remaining cash into the air and watches his guests scramble after it. That lifts his spirits, but only for a moment.<br><br>In a nearby car, Victor's replacement, Tyrus Kitt, watches Jesse's house, keeping tabs on his decline.<br><br>At the White house, Walt toasts Skyler's unexpected success with a $320 bottle of champagne, which bothers Skyler. How does it look for an unemployed school teacher to make such a purchase? Walt accuses her of overreacting. "One slip-up in our story — that could ruin us," she argues. Then adds, it was the 'insignificant' duct-tape that lead to the whole Watergate Scandal thing, to illustrate her point. To which Walt says, "I'm not Richard Nixon," and insists she's just being paranoid. He stresses it was just one bottle of champagne, paid for in cash, and no one saw him. Walt, it seems, is unable to enjoy any part of his ill-gotten gains.<br><br>Late at night, Hank watches television. Bored, anxious, and sleepless, he reaches for Gale's lab notebook and begins reading...<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br> The footage shown from the first-person perspective of Gus' camera is actual footage from the real camera.<br><br>The title of this episode refers to Marie's visits to multiple selling houses and taking articles on display, her kleptomania present again. Aditionally, the title refers to Jesse leaving his house's doors open to strangers and junkies, even allowing them to take his possessions and destroying his house.<br><br>The Go-Kart facility shown was often used by Aaron Paul and crew in their off time. The location is Albuquerque Indoor Karting .<br><br>The junkie's monologue starting from "thousands of them all over the world coming right for us" is describing a zombie attack. On S4E02 of The Walking Dead, there is a scene of zombies pushing each others through a chain link fence.<br><br> The champagne enjoyed by Walt and Skyler after sealing the car wash deal is a bottle of vintage Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill, produced by the expensive label Pol Roger.

I don't accept that he won't sell. I think he just lacks the proper...motivation."<br><br>Saul: "Motivation? Uh, as in motivation motivation? Just so we're on the same page here, you're saying we'll make him an offer he can't refuse?"<br><br>Skyler: "Nothing so dramatic as that, no. Motivation. Attitude adjustment."<br><br>Saul: "Ho ho ho ho! This one, she's a keeper."<br><br>―Skyler and Saul on how to push Bogdan to sell his business.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Saul: "Look, there's always, "You gotta real nice place here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it." That angle."<br><br>Skyler: "What are you talking about? Violence?"<br><br>Saul: "Attitude adjustment."<br><br>Skyler: "Oh no, that, no. That is not at all what I meant. We do not do that. That is not who we are, right?"<br><br>Walter: "[slight pause] Yeah, no, no, no. She's right."<br><br>―Skyler, Saul, and Walter about "Attitude adjustment".<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Skyler: "I don't like him. Bogdan. He was condescending to me, he was rude about you, and I do not like him. Simple as that."<br><br>Saul: "Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do, but in this business – and Walt can back me up on this – the number one rule is, "Don't take things personal."<br><br>Walter: "What do you mean rude about me?"<br><br>Skyler: "Something along the lines of you weren't man enough to face him yourself."<br><br>Walter: "What?"<br><br>Skyler: "That you had to send your woman to do your business for you."<br><br>Saul: "OK, uh, speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna go on record and say this is a bad idea.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Mike Ehrmantraut huddles inside a Los Pollos Hermanos refrigerated truck driving down a rural highway. The peace is suddenly interrupted by the sound of screeching tires as the truck is forced off the road by armed cartel gunmen. Recognizing that they're being attacked, Mike pulls out his pistol and cautiously listens as the gunmen pull the driver out of the cab and shoot him in the head. Mike hunkers down and draws a pistol as the two gunmen raise MP5K submachine guns and open fire on the truck, riddling it with bullets. Thinking that they've killed anyone inside, the gunmen break open the back doors. The moment they step up, Mike pops up from behind some boxes and shoots both of them, killing them instantly. Mike holsters his pistol and climbs out of the truck. As he assesses the damage, he finds that a bullet has torn off a small piece of his right ear. He pokes at it, rolls his eyes, and swears under his breath...<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>In town, Skyler White and Walter White attend a Gamblers Anonymous meeting. Back at the house, they study card-counting strategies, rehearsing Skyler's scheme to convince the family that Walt won their car wash seed money by playing blackjack. After Walt loses several hands, they decide to emphasize his struggle to recover, rather than his skills.<br><br>Skyler hands Walt a meticulously detailed script she wants them to follow at dinner with Hank Schrader, Marie Schrader, and Walter White Jr. Walt is very dissatisfied with the script and reluctantly agrees to cooperate. He further reminds Skyler that he has been and still is providing for the family and is frustrated Skyler is painting him out to look so bad. "At least you've got skills," Skyler shoots back, "I'm just the bitch mom who wouldn't cut you any slack." Walt reassesses his attitude and again apologises to Skyler for getting her involved in this whole situation. <br><br>At the Schrader home that night, Hank shows Walt and Walter, Jr. a DVD of Gale Boetticher singing karaoke, which was part of the package that was given to Hank in the last episode. Hank revels in mocking Gale's tape, which he finds hilarious. Walt is gobsmacked when he realises who's on the video and becomes increasingly uneasy, reminded of the murder, as he watches. At dinner, Skyler and Walt successfully pull off their made-up story, convincing other people that Walt indeed has a gambling problem. Walt is silently amazed at Skyler's tears-on-cue performance. Walt Jr. is most impressed and hopeful this means he'll be getting the car he's been pestering about for his birthday. Walt, to avoid all the questions, excuses himself to the bathroom but instead steals away to Hank's bedroom spying for information on Gale's murder. He shuffles through the files, is disconcerted by some crime scene shots of Gale's bloodied corpse, before finding Gale's lab notes. Just then he hears something, quickly puts back the file and runs out...<br><br>In the hallway, Walt almost collides into Hank in his wheelchair. Hank offers Walt a listening ear if ever he needs due to his gambling issues, and Walt seizes the opportunity and hints that he could equally look at the Gale Boetticher case for Hank, so they end up in Hank's bedroom, again looking over the files. Walt browses through Gale's lab notes from the superlab looking for any evidence that can be traced back to Jesse or himself. Hank believes Gale was Heisenberg, lamenting that he should've been the one to take him down. Walt asks more questions about the case, and Hank replies that there isn't much progress except some fingerprints.<br><br>Walt rushes to Jesse's house and asks him about any kind of evidence he might have left behind at Gale's place. Jesse, after being reminded about the murder, is speechless and can't seem to focus, unwilling to relive the experience. Walt insists that Jesse try to remember the event step by step, if he's sure he left to finger prints, but Jesse can't take it anymore and forces Walt out of the house by paying two of his 'guests' $100 each to play bouncer.<br><br>The next day, Walt tells Saul Goodman he fears that Hank will connect Jesse to the murder. Saul says there's nothing to worry about, but Walt catalogs his woes: Gustavo Fring wants to kill him, Jesse is out of control and Gus will eventually perceive Jesse as too big a risk. There's also "this stupid car wash" he's buying with Skyler, who naively thinks Walt can just walk away after his contract with Gus expires. Saul mentions that as a last resort, Walt can pay to have a “disappearer” vanish his family off the grid and set them up with new identities, but it should be a "last resort end-game" thing. Walt contemplates but rejects the idea, and they're stuck at an impasse.<br><br>The next morning, a tweaker watches Jesse head to his bedroom and come back with a wad of cash to keep the party going before leaving for work. He connects the dots: there's money to be had upstairs.<br><br>At the lab, Walt watches as the camera follows Jesse's every move—his worry over his partner amps up.<br><br>Jesse returns home and tosses the party guests some meth. He takes one of the party girls by the hand and takes her to his bedroom. In there, Jesse notices his money is missing but is eerily calm about it—he begins playing a videogame with the girls, nonchalantly. He really has hit rock-bottom beyond caring. <br><br>The next morning, Mike wakes Jesse and drags him downstairs, where the tweaker thief is blindfolded, beaten and a little worse for wear, on the floor beside Jesse's bag of cash and Tyrus Kitt. Mike makes him aware of the theft. Jesse coolly takes his money and walks away, telling Mike he isn't going to promise to "straighten up and fly right."<br><br>"You're on thin ice, you little shithead," Mike responds, asking if Jesse wants to know what will happen to the tweaker now. Jesse laughs. He knows Mike doesn't intend to kill the thief because he took the time to blindfold him. And either way, he doesn't seem to care what happens to him or the thief. He's not afraid of anything right now.<br><br>Mike meets with Gus and explains that Jesse is becoming a liability. Walt may not like it, Mike continues, but something has to be done.<br><br>In the lab, an incensed Walt tries in vain to reach Jesse as he handles the cook by himself. Afterwards, he rushes to Jesse's house cursing him all the way, where he finds Jesse's cell phone on the bedside table but no sign of his partner.<br><br>Walt returns to the lab. “Where is he?” Walt growls at the security camera.<br><br>Mike, driving on the highway with Jesse beside him, asks if Jesse wants to know where they're going. Calm, unaffected, Jesse says, "Nope," and they drive off into the desert.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>When Walt skims through Gale's notes at the Schraders' house, a Ron Paul 2008 sticker can be seen on one of the pages. Also, at one point, a comic strip from Gary Larson can be seen.<br><br>To create the bullet holes that strike the truck Mike is hiding inside, the special effects department drilled, wired and hand-planted 380 squib explosives onto the truck, including 150 on each side of the vehicle and 80 for the back door. Two sets of the back door were used, one for the view of shots being fired at the exterior of the door and one for the view of the interior.<br><br>For the scene with Mike waiting inside the refrigeration truck, series creator Vince Gilligan wanted audiences to be able to see his breath so they would know how cold it was. To create that effect, the special effects crew designed a tiny plastic box with holes in it and placed dry ice inside, which Banks kept inside his mouth to create condensation when he exhaled. The idea was based on a similar device film director Frank Capra previously used with his actors in one of his films, which Gilligan read about in Capra's autobiography.<br><br>The title "Bullet Points" is a possible triple reference, possibly to the Los Pollos Hermanos truck being shot at in the teaser; the bullet points Skyler used in the faux gambling addiction script that she and Walt were reading; and the discussion between Walt and Jesse about shooting Gale.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A full length Karaoke video has surfaced on Youtube, showing that David Costabile (Gale Boetticher) filmed the entire song "Major Tom"<br><br>        Breaking Bad's Gale sings "Major Tom" (Complete Song) -HD-    <br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br>David Costabile as Gale Boetticher<br><br>Jeremy Howard as Sketchy<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br>Ray Campbell as Tyrus<br><br>Frank Andrade as Tweaker Thief<br><br>Paul Neis as Support Group Leader<br><br>Brittany Gustin as Morning After Girl<br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Anthony Molinari as Gunman #1<br><br>Marco Morales as Gunman #2<br><br><br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br>"Days Like This" by Melani L.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Walter White races through busy Albuquerque streets, dodging traffic while shouting instructions to Saul Goodman on his cell phone. If Walt doesn't return within 24 hours, Saul is to deliver all of Walt's money to Skyler White. Walt then calls Skyler and leaves a hurried message but trying not to sound desperate, telling her he loves her: evidently, Walt is heading into some kind of showdown and is aware he might not come out of it alive. He places his gun on the front passenger seat next to him in anticipation...<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Armed with his .38, Walt storms into Los Pollos Hermanos and demands to speak with Gustavo Fring. The manager says that Gus isn't there, but Walt doesn't believe her. He states that he's seen Gus's car parked outside so he'll wait until Gus is called out. While he waits, Mike Ehrmantraut calls him to ask what he's doing, then tells him that Jesse Pinkman will be with him for the day, and puts a blase Jesse on the phone when Walt insists on speaking to him. Jesse confirms he's ok, does not have a gun pointed at him, but doesn't know where they're going. Mike then tells Walt that today he'll just have to handle the cook alone. Walt pushes his way into Gus' office only to be surprised that it's empty.<br><br>Out in the desert, Mike drives up a long dirt road. Despite seeming not to care whether he lives or dies, Walt's worry has set Jesse on edge so he positions his keys between his fingers to use as a probable weapon. He watches nervously as Mike exits the car and grabs a shovel from the trunk. Is this it? But Mike passes Jesse by and starts digging. After a few moments, Mike pulls a bag of money out of the ground and tosses it in the trunk. Mike tells Jesse that they have six more collections to make today and he wants to have it done before dark.<br><br>At home, Hank Schrader jokes with Tim about the oddball personality that Gale's notebook evokes: "it's like Scarface had sex with Mr. Rogers." He then identifies Badger and Jesse as the only people directly tied to the blue meth that he knows of. Hank admits to having "a history" with Jesse (referring to the savage beat-down he delivered last season) but doubts that Jesse murdered Gale. Finding Gale dead, the man he now believes is his Heisenberg, "feels like closure," so he no longer wants to contribute to the investigation. "I feel like I'm done," he apologizes. <br><br>Mike makes his next pickup at an abandoned warehouse and finds Jesse standing guard when he returns to the car. If he's accompanying Mike "in a guard-type capacity," says Jesse, then he needs a gun. He doesn't, Mike replies, implying he's not going to guard anything here.<br><br>As the pickups—shown in a sped-up montage set to humorous music—continue, Jesse becomes increasingly bored and frustrated. If he's riding shotgun as "the guy" on this assignment, then Mike should tell him what they're doing and why, or at very least get a little conversation going to help relieve his boredom.  <br><br>Mike abruptly pulls the car over and barks that in no way is Jesse "the guy" (implying that Victor, whom Gus killed, had been his guy). There may be some reason Gus has for sending Jesse on this mission, but Mike does not know it. "Sit here, shut up, and stay in the car," Mike says.<br><br>In the lab, Walt has difficulty managing both his and Jesse's portions of the prep work. After starting the cook Walt returns home to sign papers finalizing the loan to buy the car wash. For them to succeed going forward, Skyler tells Walt, they have to be completely honest with each other. "I'm all for that," Walt assures her.<br><br>Skyler then plays her phone messages and hears Walt say that he loves her. The two stare at each other meaningfully for a moment, then rush into the bedroom in the heat of passion. Later, Walter Jr. arrives home and realizes that his parents are having (or just had) sex. Skyler frets over Walter Jr.'s reaction and suggests that Walt move back home "so it's easier to explain to everyone." Walt kisses Skyler in reply.<br><br>Later, back at the lab, Walt drops a barrel of methylamine while struggling with the forklift. Fed up, he screams at the security camera that the cook is a two-man job. He's not cooking anything until Jesse returns. A while later Tyrus Kitt arrives at the lab and operates the forklift for Walt. Jesse's not coming just because Walt asks for him.<br><br>Mike makes the final pickup of the evening at another abandoned warehouse. While he's inside, a second vehicle arrives, and Jesse notices one of its occupants approaching Mike's car with a shotgun. Jesse, convinced Mike is about to be robbed (or finally be "offed"), shifts into reverse, floors it, knocks the gunman to the ground, and slams into the other car. Then he peels out in an attempt to lose the gunman and his cohort.<br><br>A bit later, Jesse catches up with Mike elsewhere walking in town, picks him up, and explains what went down outside the warehouse. "I saw," says Mike, impressed enough to finally let Jesse smoke in his car.<br><br>The next morning, over coffee in the White's kitchen, Walter Jr. tells Walt, "Mom said you're moving back in.” It's news to Walt, whose face tightens even further when he notices that Walter Jr. is drinking out of a Beneke mug.<br><br>Later at the lab, Jesse tells Walt that he spent the previous day guarding Mike and bristles when Walt makes light of the notion, "What, you guarding Mike?" Two dudes tried to rob them, Jesse retorts, and he took care of business.<br><br>Mike and Gus rendezvous outside Los Pollos Hermanos. Everything with Jesse went the way Gus planned, Mike reports. "The kid's a hero, just as you wanted," he says. The gunman clearly was a plant, and Gus set it all up for Jesse's benefit.<br><br>At Hank and Marie's house for dinner, Walt anxiously swills wine in the kitchen as Skyler discusses the car wash. When Hank jokingly refers to Walt as famous card shark "Nick the Greek," Marie criticizes him for enabling Walt's gambling addiction.<br><br>Walter Jr. changes the subject to the Boetticher case. Hank says that he's stopped working on it, but praises Gale as not merely a cook, a bona fide genius: "He was a meth chef. I mean, we're talking five stars, candles and white tablecloth."  That if he had set his mind to something good, who knows what he'd be able to achieve to help people. Walt, increasingly irate from Hank's assertions and by now a little tipsy, can't let someone else take credit for his work. He dismisses the "Lab Notes" journal as "simple rote copying, probably of someone else's work." Skyler looks on disbelievingly as Walt muses that "this genius" of Hank's might still be at large. (If Walt hadn't said any of this Hank would not have reopened his investigation, but Walt's pride gets the better of him. It has before and it will do so again later.) <br><br>The next morning, Hank tells Marie—in a more polite tone than he's used with her in quite some time, even apologizing for making a small mess on the kitchen table—that he's resumed looking into the Boetticher case. Looking through police photographs taken in Gale's apartment, Hank notices a leaflet from Los Pollos Hermanos, with some letters and numbers—perhaps a serial or model number for some product—inked at the bottom.<br><br>Reflecting on Gale's dietary habits, Hank wonders aloud to Marie, "Since when do vegans eat fried chicken?"<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>The episode title, "Shotgun" is a reference to both Jesse riding shotgun with Mike and to the shotgun the attacker is holding when approaching Jesse.<br><br> There's a slight reference to the pilot episode of the show in this episode. At the table, Hank says "I've got your wipe-down right here" and grabs his crotch; this is very similar to what Walter said and did to Bogdan as he was leaving the job.<br><br> During the musical cue ("1977" by Ana Tijoux)  Jesse, while bored, mindlessly taps Mike's dashboard and sings: "Fallacies, fallacies, one for you, and two for me" a line from Fallacies by TwaüghtHammër. He previously sang this exact same line in the superlab ("I See You") while mindlessly zipping the zipper of his protective suit up and down, also while bored, also during a musical cue ("Shimmy Shimmy Ya" by Prince Fatty feat. Horseman).<br><br> The song Jesse is humming while he waits in the car during the final pickup is also Fallacies by TwaüghtHammër (Jesse's old band in the show).<br><br>Production error: when Mike and Jesse drive to the dessert at the begining of the episode on a dirt road you can see a camera and a guy behind it shooting the scene.

                                        Directed by Michael Slovis .

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Reminiscent of the teaser of "Bullet Points," Cartel thugs (led by cartel buttonman Gaff) ambush a Los Pollos Hermanos refrigerated truck. Like before, they shoot and kill the driver. But rather than shoot up the truck like before, they proceed to bar the back doors to lock the guards in. They then hook up a tube to the exhaust pipe to redirect the exhaust into the truck's ventilation system and floor on the gas pedal. Gaff and his crew then eat the driver's lunch as the guards suffocate to death from carbon monoxide fumes. Once the guards die, the thugs break into the truck and take a single marked container of fry batter.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         "I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger."   <br><br>Skyler White repeatedly listens to Walter White's message while reading up on Gale Boetticher and finally reads between the message's lines correctly. She asks Walt several questions concerning Gale's murder and the people he works for. She asks if he's safe. Walt dodges these questions. Skyler theorizes that Walt is scared and that some part of him wants Hank to catch him. Walt (& his pride again) rejects these theories. Walt talks about how the whole drug enterprise would fall if he didn't show up for work. He claims "I'm not in danger. I am the danger!"..."I don't open the door (to a bullet) but instead he is the one doing the knocking ." Skyler doesn't respond, but is clearly shocked, even appalled and concerned at who Walt is turning into - she looks at him as if he's a stranger. After Walt finishes showering, he comes out voicing a reassuring apology, only to realize mid-sentence that Skyler, Holly and her car are gone. Walt goes to the car wash alone to obtain the files and keys. Bogdan Wolynetz talks about how bosses have to be tough and is not sure if Walt is ready for that. He insultingly recommends that if he's not tough enough, he should call his wife. Bogdan reminds Walt that the place is sold "as it is." When he then wants to take back the first dollar he made (hanging in a frame on the wall), Walt responds with "as is", and with a wry smile insists he leave it behind. Bogdan storm off in a huff. He then uses Bogdan's first dollar to buy a can of soda, relishing the moment.<br><br>Mike Ehrmantraut and Jesse Pinkman sit in a diner, Mike eating dinner and Jesse drinking coffee. Noticing Jesse's shaking hands, Mike asks if he's okay. Jesse indirectly tells him he is in withdrawal by telling him he "isn't using," which concerns Mike so he offers his dinner to Jesse. Shortly after, Mike receives a phone call, leaves some money and leaves to attend to whatever. Jesse offers to go along but Mike leaves him behind. <br><br>Walt and Walter White Jr. are eating breakfast. They talk and Walter Jr. assumes how Skyler is angry at Walt due to his 'gambling addiction.' Walt says she has a right to be mad. Walt Jr. tries to excuse his father's actions as equal to an illness, but Walt angrily counters that it was all down to "choice" and he owns it. On the way to school, after an argument, Walt decides to take a detour and buy a car for Walt Jr. At first he accuses Walt of attempting to "buy him off" but soon lights up when Walt buys him his dream car, a 2009 Dodge Challenger.<br><br>Jesse and Walt meet outside the superlab and Walt asks about the 'Mike meetings.' Jesse replies that he's guarding him on pickups. To Walt none of this 'guarding Mike' makes any sense. Jesse meanwhile is energised by what he did, telling Walt that maybe he's not "just a loser" after all. Walt then theorizes that the robbery was probably a setup - which Jesse refuses to even contemplate, let alone believe, angry that Walt is belittling him again. Walt tries to get Jesse to understand : Gustavo Fring can't kill Jesse because Walt won't stand for it. Gus needs Walt and he hates that, so he's trying to drive a wedge between Jesse and Walt. But when Walt ends with : "This whole thing is about me" - Jesse can't take any more, both angry and disappointed, he stalks off to go cook. <br><br>Halfway through cooking, Jesse receives a phone call and leaves go out with Mike again. Walt is incensed to again be left to clean up by himself. In defiance he goes straight upstairs and asks three Spanish-speaking women working in the laundromat for help cleaning the lab. They refuse to go downstairs, seemingly afraid to, until Walt offers them more money for 2 hours work than they're used to. Walt sits back and raises his coffee cup to the surveillance camera with a knowing smile, while the women scrub the lab equipment.<br><br>Skyler drives to the Four Corners landmark and, exasperated, flips a coin. It lands in Colorado. She frowns, flips again, and again it lands in Colorado. Skyler, using her foot, drags the coin from the Colorado square to New Mexico. She looks at Holly, picks up the coin and gets back in the car.<br><br><br><br>         Mike and Jesse waiting outside a junkie's house   <br><br>Jesse and Mike drive up to a house. Three guys inside are selling three pounds of blue meth that they didn't get from Gus. Mike advises that they should stake out the place until someone leaves, but Jesse, impatient as always, decides to play the junkie act and infiltrate the house. After getting the door slammed in his face, Mike taunts him with a "back to Plan-A then?" as Jesse gets back in the car. Jesse, however, insists Mike might know 'stake-outs' but he knows 'junkies', so he gets back out of the car and takes a shovel out of the trunk. Jesse starts digging a hole in the front yard of the house. One junkie approaches him as Mike watches from the car. The junkie asks why he's digging and Jesse replies "You know why." Jesse asks "How deep do you think it is?" The junkie replies "Pretty deep." Then Jesse hands the shovel to the junkie and asks him to take over the digging. He also asks if he can use their bathroom and the tweaker agrees, digging away anxiously. Inside, there's another junkie all the worse for wear, gripping a shotgun over his shoulders. After pretending to wanting to buy some blue meth and getting rejected, Jesse keeps pushing it and the tweaking paranoid junkie aggressively points the gun at Jesse. After the junkie is distracted by the noise of Mike coming to check, Jesse knocks the tweaker out with a nearby bong. Mike finds and picks up the stolen Los Pollos Hermanos fry batter bucket; words in Spanish are written on the lid in big black letters - which translates roughly to : "Are [you] ready to talk?" ... Obviously a message for Gus and company.<br><br>Walt walks out of the superlab with the three Spanish-speaking women. Tyrus Kitt approaches them and takes the women away. He's sending them on a bus back to Honduras (if not having them shot ??) - After Walt asks him to have Gus blame him instead and not the women, Tyrus replies "He does blame you."<br><br>Mike and Jesse again eat at a diner. Gus walks in and sits at the booth. Jesse knows he has to wait outside. Mike informs Gus that the whole truck robbery was about sending a message, the one on the bucket. Mike recommends that he get 10 or 15 good operators and retaliate immediately. But Gus dismisses this and wants to set up a meeting. Before leaving he asks Mike how Jesse did that day. As he leaves, he tells Jesse outside that he heard that he can handle himself. Jesse asks Gus "Why me?" Gus responds with "I like to think I can see things in people." Jesse doesn't quite know what to make of it but seems somewhat buoyed nevertheless. <br><br>Skyler drives into the driveway and is unimpressed to see the new car Walt bought for their son. Walt Jr. tries to convince his mom that the car is safe and promises he'll drive it safely. Walt, seeing Skyler silently seething, tries to apologize and says that everything he does, he does for his family. Skyler chides Walt about the new car and how it's a stupid idea that directly contradicts the story they're supposed to be following. She wants it sent back the next day. Walt attempts the sly angle that if he does so he worries Walt Jr. will only blame her for taking away the car. Skyler's well aware she'll be blamed the "bitch mom" again and 'thanks' Walt for once again placing her in that position. When Walt insists he only wished to do something nice for his son and provide as a father should; and again that he's only protecting the family. Skyler insist that if his reckless buying of an expensive car is his idea of protecting their son and the family, then she'd have to step up - "Someone has to protect this family from the man that protects this family." She picks up Holly White and takes her to her room, slamming the door behind her, leaving Walt sullen and speechless ... as the screen fades to black.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>When giving his "I am the one who knocks" speech, Walter takes off his light red shirt to reveal a darker shade of red symbolizing a darker turn for Walter after the speech.<br><br>When Jesse tries to enter the house, he uses the name "Diesel," which is the same name he used last time he was trying to recover stolen meth from junkies in "Peekaboo".<br><br>The episode title name may refer to:<br><br>Skyler cornering Walt with several questions<br><br>Walt is cornered into giving back the car<br><br>The trapped guards in the refrigerated truck<br><br>Skyler's visit to the Four Corners landmark.<br><br><br><br>There is a continuity error in this episode.

A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me?

                        <div class="ui message"><p>At home, on a massive TV screen, playing the first-person shooter video game Rage, Jesse Pinkman fires a gun at the mutants attacking him. Images of Gale Boetticher's dead body/murder blend in with the action as Jesse replays the real-life gunshot and Gale falling dead in his mind's eye. Distracted and disturbed, Jesse dies in the game. He catches his breath. The memory fades, and he restarts.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Walt looks at the explosion of the Challenger   <br><br>At the car wash, Walter White grouses about the restocking fee the dealership is charging to take back the Challenger. Skyler White pleads with him to just return the car and not make a scene. She wants them to be done with it. Instead, Walt drives to an empty parking lot and races around recklessly, laying heavy rubber and doing doughnuts until the car runs aground on a parking block. Without a pause, Walt gets out, sets the car on fire and casually calls for a taxi as he sits down on the concrete and watches it burn.<br><br>Walt slumps in a chair at Saul Goodman's office while Saul handles the fallout from his client's "little joy ride." Walt admits that the pressure of knowing Gustavo Fring wants to kill him is getting to him, and then inquires about hit men. "Wrong answer!" blurts Saul, pointing out that any for hire assailant would likely know Mike Ehrmantraut, and have to outmaneuver him. Walt tells Saul that he tried to kill Gus himself but couldn't get near him. "Why not ask your partner?" suggests Saul. That night at Jesse's house, while Jesse repaints his graffitied/damaged walls, Walt interrogates Jesse about how close he's been to Gus lately. Closer than they are right now, Jesse says, adding, "He said he sees something in me." Walt attempts to manipulate Jesse, ironically asking if he's that easily manipulated by Gus. If he's already forgotten what Gus attempted. Walt reminds him Gus tried to kill them both, did kill Victor, and lied about not targeting children the day Andrea's brother Tomás was shot — he's making his case for Jesse to take action. "Drop the sales pitch," Jesse barks back at Walt. "I'll kill him first chance I get." Walt smiles, inwardly triumphant, pleased to get Jesse just where he wants him.<br><br>The next day at the car wash, Marie Schrader tells Skyler how well Hank Schrader's therapy is going and that his spirits have improved. Walt sneaks $274,000 in drug money past them hidden in pallets of soda. After Marie leaves, Skyler and Walt regroup. Skyler is stunned to realize that Walt's yearly income is more than $7 million. Skyler protests that it's too much to launder, and nobody pays for a carwash with $50 notes. She needs to solve that problem, Walt replies coldly - it's what she wanted to do, he reminds her. Skyler reminds him she wanted nothing of this. If she rather wants out, Walt counters, she must just say so. Skyler ain't pleased, but packs the cash into the safe, and starts mulling things over...<br><br>In the superlab, out of the security camera's view, Walt cooks a batch of ricin. At his house that night, Jesse notes that they had more of the poison when they tried to murder Tuco Salamanca ("Seven Thirty-Seven")  ("Grilled"). It's enough, says Walt. Jesse just needs to slip some into Gus's food or drink and Gus will die within 36 hours of seemingly natural causes. Jesse conceals the slim ricin vial inside a cigarette that he returns to the pack upside-down as his "lucky cigarette." Walt emphasizes, whatever you do just don't smoke it!<br><br>Walter White Jr. drives Hank to Los Pollos Hermanos, where Hank chats briefly with Gus, who recognizes him from his charity work with the DEA. Gus replenishes Hank's soda and offers to pay for any future meals at Los Pollos Hermanos, even offers Walt Jr. a job if ever he wants one. Hank later slips the cup into an evidence bag and stashes it under his seat in the car.<br><br><br><br>         Mike and Jesse at the factory farm   <br><br>The next day, Mike and Jesse drive to Gus's factory farm. "Big doin's today," says Mike. Inside the office trailer, Mike discusses security arrangements with Gus while Jesse makes coffee, his hands shaking as he holds his cigarette pack, trying to decide what to do. Mike startles Jesse by offering him a loaded gun. "Emergency only," Mike says. Three Cartel members arrive at the farm, fewer than Mike expected. Only one, Gaff (the lead assassin who hijacked the Los Pollos Hermanos truck in the previous episode), meets with Gus, who is visibly slighted of dealing with a henchman but forces a smile and offers him a seat. Speaking in Spanish, Gus offers the Cartel $50 million. "In return, our business is over," he says. Gaff replies that Gus knows what the Cartel wants. Is his answer yes or no! in reference to the last episode where the bucket read "ready to talk"? Is Gus ready to talk to the cartel, yes or no? Gus seems to have made an error in judgement: "This is not a negotiation," Gaff says, bluntly. Outside moments later, Gaff and Gus stare each other down as the Cartel members depart. Jesse considers shooting Gus in the back with the gun Mike gave him, right there and then, but ultimately decides against it. On the drive back to town, Jesse asks Mike what it is Gus sees in him. "Loyalty," Mike replies. "Only, maybe you got it for the wrong guy."<br><br>That evening, Jesse attends the N.A. support group meeting and indirectly bares his soul about killing Gale, telling a story about a fictitious "problem dog" he put down. Another addict criticizes Jesse for animal cruelty, but the group leader cautions the group not to judge. Jesse asks why not. Is he supposed to just "accept" himself no matter how many "dogs" he kills? He reiterates to his team leader that "killing one's own child should never be or ever become acceptable." Breaking down under the weight of the guilt, Jesse lashes out, saying he's really at the meetings only to sell meth to them all. "I made you my bitch," he sneers. "You accept that?" The group leader]] takes this in as Jesse charges out. Later at the superlab, Walt asks Jesse about the progress of the assassination attempt. Jesse lies and says he hasn't seen Gus.<br><br><br><br>         Gus Fring's fingerprints are found at Gale's apartment   <br><br>Hank meets with Steven Gomez and ASAC George Merkert at the DEA. He describes Gale and his murder, and hypothesizes that Gale is Heisenberg's former cook. The letters and numbers scribbled on the Los Pollos Hermanos napkin found in Gale's apartment, Hank explains, were the parts number for an industrial air-filtration system that Gale took delivery on. A system, Hank notes, perfect "for the biggest meth lab north of the border." By coincidence, its manufacturer is owned by a German-based conglomerate called Madrigal Electromotive that also has a stake in Los Pollos Hermanos. Hank theorizes that a vegan like Gale wouldn't eat at a chicken restaurant, and further that he'd only go to Los Pollos Hermanos for a meeting, perhaps with Gus. "What do we know about Gustavo Fring?" asks Hank, questioning Gus's supposed affinity for law enforcement. "Maybe he's our guy." Merkert suggests that Hank is "really reaching." Hank concedes that he thought so too at first. But one thing troubles him, says Hank, pausing for effect as he reveals photographs of a fingerprint on a Los Pollos soda cup and prints from the crime scene. "What are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment, then?" Hank asks, laying his trump card on the table.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>In the teaser, Jesse is playing the video game, RAGE.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In a flashback to the same previously seen hospital scene just after Hank Schrader's shooting ("I See You"), Walter White confronts Gustavo Fring about who was behind the attempt on his life. Mike Ehrmantraut slips away, unnoticed, after murdering the Cousin who survived the ambush. Later, still in flashback, Hector Salamanca seethes silently in a nursing home as he watches news coverage of the shootings. Gus drops by for a visit, switches off the TV set, props himself on a chair opposite Hector and offers to better recount the events for him personally. Almost victoriously Gus describes his nephews' - the Cousins' - deaths, and the cryptic warning Hank received before the attack. Which, he relishes in pointing out, caused them to lose the upper hand and thereby their lives. Cartel boss Juan Bolsa is also dead, Gus reports with more sadistic glee. "This is what comes," says Gus, quoting Bolsa's own phrase, "of 'blood for blood'." "Sangre por sangre," he repeats in Spanish, be it for emphasis or Hector's clear understanding; who is by now beside himself with rage, his red faced temper desperate to push through his paralysis, as Gus leaves him with a patronising pat on the knee. <br><br>As Don Hector rages, we cut to water that grows tinged with blood. <br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Back in the present at an oncology clinic, another patient tries to commiserate with Walt. Walt won't hear it; he dismisses the young man's suggestion that cancer has put the man's life on hold. "That is such bullshit," says Walt. "Every single life comes with a death sentence." Until then, he's the one in charge, not cancer. Later at the superlab, Gus observes Walt's every move on the security camera feed; despite his vehemence, Walt's not in charge of anything right now.<br><br><br><br>         The DEA questions Gus   <br><br>The APD and DEA summon Gus to APD headquarters, where he notices a Person-of-Interest sketch of Victor on a bulletin board. Hank Schrader, APD Detective Tim Roberts, Steven Gomez and ASAC George Merkert then greet a fully composed Gus. Tim reveals that Gus's fingerprints were found at a murder scene. Hank scrutinises his every word and move intently. "Gale Boetticher's apartment?" Gus offers. Gale, he explains, won a chemistry scholarship that Gus established some years ago to honor Maximino Arciniega, "a dear friend of mine who died too young." Gale reestablished contact recently, and over dinner at Gale's apartment (thus explaining Gus's fingerprints) he proposed a "vague investment opportunity" that Gus declined. That would seem to explain everything, but Hank presses on: "Is Gustavo Fring your real name?" Hank asks before rattling off Gus's bio: Chilean national who emigrated to Mexico in 1986 and to the U.S. a few years later. Hank wonders why no record of Gus exists in Chile. This catches Gus by surprise, but he's perfectly composed, recovering instantly. "The Pinochet dictatorship kept notoriously unreliable records", Gus replies, assuring Hank that he'll locate documentation eventually if he persists. After Gus departs, Hank and his colleagues discuss their impressions. Hank's colleagues are convinced by the scholarship story and his calm composure. It's good, Hank admits, though he wonders why a supposed law-enforcement booster, with so many 'cop buddies', didn't come forward sooner with information about a murder case he's been clearly aware of. Clearly, he's not satisfied. But the head detective reasons with Hank that they can't go around investigating people just because they failed to volunteer information.  <br><br>Saul Goodman visits Andrea Cantillo at a house she's just rented in a nice neighborhood and delivers cash from Jesse Pinkman. Afterward, in Saul's car, a concerned Jesse asks about the house and Andrea's son, Brock. Saul then prods Jesse to check on them himself.<br><br>At home, Skyler White conceals cash in vacuum-sealed plastic bags of clothes, and then hangs them in her closet. The weight of all the bags quickly sags, then snaps, the closet support rod. Desperate for a solution, she stashes the bags in the crawl space under the house. At dinner that night, Walt gives his family the news that his cancer is still in remission, much to all their relief. Marie Schrader mentions that Hank met with top DEA people about something "very hush-hush." Uncomfortable, Hank changes the subject and asks Walt to drive him to a mineral show the next day. Walt, piqued by Marie's admission, agrees to pick up and drive Hank.<br><br><br><br>         Hank and Walter at Los Pollos Hermanos   <br><br>The next day as they drive Walt feigns interest in minerals but Hank soon admits there's no actual mineral show and instead directs Walt to the Los Pollos Hermanos parking lot. "Ready to get your mind blown?" Hank asks. He suspects Gus Fring is a major drug distributor, and to prove it, Hank wants Walt to plant a GPS tracker in the wheel-well of Gus's Volvo. While Hank gives an apprehensive Walt installation instructions, Mike pulls up beside Walt's car and stares him down. Walt, panicking, tries to dissuade Hank. "This is a mistake," says Walt. Hank refuses to take 'no' for an answer, "Jesus, don't make me beg," he replies. Walt covertly exchanges some looks with Mike, then reluctantly exits the car. He approaches the Volvo and drops to his knee, to 'tie his shoe' as Hank suggested, but doesn't plant the device. He then proceeds into Los Pollos Hermanos, where Gus immediately greets him at the till. "I didn't do it," says Walt, flashing the GPS device and informing Gus of what's going down. "Do it," Gus says evenly, then repeats it when Walt dithers. He returns to the parking lot, drink order in hand, and this time plants the GPS tracker. Hank's unsure why Walt's returned to the car and winces at Walt's inept bungling, things not going quite as smoothly as he'd hoped. Returning to the car to Hank's puzzled looks, Walt explains he was just checking the device was securely attached on that second pass. Hank, changes the subject with an awkward, "So, where's my drink then?", on noticing Walt had only ordered a single drink. Walt's flustered...  <br><br>Back at the superlab, Walt rushes to the security camera and addresses Gus. Hank has no hard evidence and his colleagues don't buy his theory, Walt says, begging Gus not to harm Hank, as they have nothing on him. Later, Walt visits Jesse at home and says that Gus must be killed this week, preferably tonight. He updates Jesse on why the need urgency. No meetings with Gus are scheduled, says Jesse, but when Jesse briefly steps away, Walt surreptitiously reads an incoming text on Jesse's phone about a canceled meeting. "Boss is busy, will have to meet later" it reads. When Jesse returns, Walt informs him he probably has a call; then waits to check if Jesse will inform him or instead lie. When Jesse dismisses the call as nothing important, Walt is displeased, disappointed and concerned why Jesse is lying to him - but of that, he's just had proof of. <br><br>Mike calls Gus the next day and reports that neither the police nor the DEA considers him a suspect. Hank is operating solo. "What about Chile?" asks Gus. Mike can't find anything about Gus there, so Hank probably won't either. Gus enquires if Hank requested a search warrant for the tracker and is pleased to hear he did not. A more serious concern, says Mike, is what would happen if Hank witnesses the Cartel moving against Gus. Gus removes the GPS tracker from his car and stows it on a nearby newspaper dispenser before he drives to the nursing home, where he informs Hector that he has defied the Cartel's ultimatum and that Hank is looking into Gus's past. "Is today the day, Hector?" Gus asks cryptically.<br><br><br><br>         Gus and Max in 1989   <br><br>In another flashback, it's 1989. Gus and his partner, Max Arciniega, sit poolside at a lavish Mexican hacienda. A younger and much sprightlier Don Hector walks out, urinates in the pool right next to them, and otherwise disrespects Gus and Max in front of Juan Bolsa (insinuating they "liked" watching him urinate - a probable dig at their sexuality.)  Don Eladio Vuente -- the Cartel boss—strides out and compliments Gus and Max on their delicious chicken, saying that all his men love it. His demeanor changes, though, when he mentions that his men also get high on "metanfetamina" they receive from Gus and Max. Simply samples, Gus replies, for Don Eladio, to get his attention - insisting there was never monetary exchange for the drugs. Don Eladio calls meth the poor man's cocaine because there's no money in it. Max tells them that Gus is a honourable man who paid for all his studies. That he's now a trained biochemist and chemical engineer and can make a much superior product to what the Don is used to seeing - a very potent and pure crystal form of the product which he can teach his people to make. Gus points out that Don Eladio assumes great risk smuggling cocaine into the United States, but then must send much of the profit back to the Colombians, since the drug precursor plant can't be grown in Mexico. With meth made locally, he'd control the entirety of the product and get to keep all of the profits for himself. This, they promise, would easily triple if not even quadruple, his profits.<br><br>Don Eladio, despite seemingly liking the idea, accuses Gus of insulting him by disrespecting him by selling under his nose, then manipulating him into a meeting in front of his own men. Gus apologizes and states he was merely using his initiative, but Max senses Don Eladio's anger, and the rising danger to Gus. "He is my partner!" pleads Max. "I need him." While Max speaks about Gus' great skills and qualities, Hector steps up behind him and shoots him through the head. Juan Bolsa pushes Gus to the ground, and Hector places his foot on Gus's neck, forcing him to look into his partner's dead eyes, only inches away from his own, as Max bleeds out into the pool. "You did this to him," says Hector. "Now look at him." Don Eladio tells Gus that he remains alive only because Don Eladio knows who he actually is. "But understand," warns Don Eladio, "You are not in Chile anymore." (Clearly Gus has had a lucky escape due solely to his previous identity/reputation when back home in Chile.) <br><br>Back in the present at the nursing home, Gus leans in close to Don Hector. "Look at me, Hector," he commands, but Hector stubbornly refuses, eyes fixed intently away from him. "Maybe next time," taunts Gus, leaving Hector silently fuming in his chair.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>The "Hermanos" of the title is the Spanish word for : Brothers. ... The titles in BB usually refer to multiple points within an episode. The most obvious 'Hermanos' here probably alludes to the relationship between the two "brothers" at the centre of the 'Los Pollos Hermanos' franchise, i.e. Gus & Max - which is the main theme at the centre of this episode and explains the motivation for Gus' avenging of his dear "brother's" killing. ... The word, or sentiment of the word, 'brother' (or even the more urban 'brutha') can easily be exchangeable with the word 'partner', as it does here. It's been established that Gus & Max were not true 'brothers' in blood, but more so 'partner' brothers. (Plus, extended further, even quite possibly : 'partners' in the more gay/homosexual sense of the word - as has been established is probable they were.) ... So in that hermanos/partner sense, the title could also be referring to : Mike and Jesse's partnership, and how Walt might be feeling betrayed by his 'hermano' on discovering he's being lied to by his partner Jesse. ... Thirdly, at more of a stretch but still fits - it might also be referring to the 'brothers-in-law' double act of Hank and Walt, in the car with the tracking device. 'Brothers-in-law' directly translated is 'hermanos-en-ley', or more so 'hermanos políticos' / (and though that's strictly accurate, to be fair the more casual word 'cuñados' is more often used.)  <br><br>Additionally, brothers may refer to The Cousins who were twin brothers.  The Cousins' deaths were used as a trigger to enrage Hector Salamanca while Gustavo gloated.  <br><br>From this episode we learn that Gus' killings have in fact been motivated not merely by 'business' but also, more deeply so, by revenge - a "blood for blood" revenge against Hector in particular and the Cartel in general for their killing of his partner Max. It's possible it was the loss of Max, his killing and Gus' avenging hand thereof, that's responsible for ultimately turning Gus into the ruthless killer/villain he becomes.<br><br>Although Gus and Max's deep relationship was never outright confirmed by the show as being a homosexual one, it was interpreted by many of the more astute viewers as certainly being so. Series creator Vince Gilligan has stated that he decided against the show officially confirming or denying whether or not Max and Gus were, in fact, a couple; however, he's also said that they "probably were lovers." Even Esposito himself (i.e. Giancarlo Esposito - the actor who portrayed Gus) interpreted the character as probably being gay.<br><br>Vince Gilligan has said Gus Fring was likely involved with former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet's government somewhere. However, the writers had deliberately not determined his entire back story in order to keep the character not only more interesting/mysterious but also allow them some greater flexibility for future episodes' story/character development. The two instances that demonstrate this likely involvement in said government, is 1) the fact that Gus apparently left Chile in 1986 - the very year of Pinochet's attempted assassination (by the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front) and 2) The fact that Hector Salamanca has referred to Gus as "Grand Generalissimo". The added tidbit that Don Eladio tells Gus that he knew who Gus was but he's "not in Chile anymore", hints at the probability that Gus held some sort of clout when back home that he no longer holds.<br><br>The first article of clothing that Skyler places along with the money in the vacuum bags is the pink sweater that Walt wore in the episode "ABQ."  The sweater is the same shade of pink as the Teddy Bear from the Wayfarer 515 crash.<br><br>Max Arciniega is the same name as the actor who played Krazy-8.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Mark Margolis as Hector Salamanca<br><br>Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez<br><br>Emily Rios as Andrea Cantillo<br><br>Michael Shamus Wiles as ASAC George Merkert<br><br><br><br><br><br>Javier Grajeda as Juan Bolsa<br><br>Nigel Gibbs as APD Detective Tim Roberts<br><br>James Martinez as Max Arciniega<br><br>Steven Bauer as Don Eladio Vuente<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br>Lavell Crawford as Huell<br><br>Ian Posada as Brock<br><br>Michael Sheets as Cancer Patient<br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Daniel Moncada as Leonel Salamanca (archive footage)<br><br>Michael R.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In a flash-forward, we hear heavy breathing and see a broken pair of eyeglasses on the floor. Blood drips onto the floor and on to a familiar pair of Wallabee shoes. A man's hand struggles to pick up the glasses. Upon retrieving them, he slowly stumbles away.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Hank and Walt view the GPS data   <br><br>Walter White drives Hank Schrader to Los Pollos Hermanos. Though he's unaware Tyrus Kitt is tailing them, Hank senses Walt's anxiety and attempts to lighten the mood by humming the theme song from Rocky III. Walt retrieves the GPS locator from Gustavo Fring's car but refuses to enter the restaurant this time, much to Hank's annoyance who was hoping for a vanilla milkshake. Back home, Hank curses when the GPS data reveals that Gus only made trips between home and one Los Pollos Hermanos location. He's either squeaky clean, suspiciously so, or very careful. "How do I get this guy?" Hank wonders aloud. "Yeah," echoes Walt, wondering precisely the same thing, in a different ma. "How?" Leaving Hank's house, Walt spots Tyrus surveilling them. He pulls up to Tyrus' car and calls 911 to report a suspicious man in the neighborhood, forcing Tyrus to leave.<br><br>Outside the Lavandería Brillante, Walt is mildly taken aback when Jesse Pinkman says that he's already started the cook. Walt bums a cigarette and sees the ricin still in Jesse's pack. Jesse insists that he still intends to poison Gus. Walt lights his cigarette over Jesse's disapproval—not the smartest move for a cancer patient. Walt shrugs it off: "We're both dead men anyway,” he replies.<br><br>That evening, Skyler White calls Walt from the car wash and suggests that they buy Walter White Jr. a used car for his sixteenth birthday. Walt agrees without enthusiasm. Skyler then reports that the "profits" are so good that Walt could begin preparing "an exit strategy" from his "second job." Walt, however, knows that there's no way out as long as Gus is alive. The next morning, Hank calls Walt and proposes a drive out to what Hank theorizes is Gus' meth distribution center. Knowing that Hank means the Los Pollos Hermanos Factory Farm, Walt feigns illness and convinces Hank to delay the trip; he then calls and warns Mike Ehrmantraut. At the factory farm, Mike directs Jesse and other operatives to hide all evidence of meth distribution.<br><br>Meanwhile at the car wash, Skyler makes false purchases between actual customers, to help account for all the extra money Walt's giving her. Ted Beneke then visits Skyler and tells her that the IRS is auditing his business. As the bookkeeper of record, Skyler realizes that a criminal investigation would permit agents to monitor her mail and phone calls, and probably open the books at the car wash—a disaster across the board.<br><br><br><br>         Gus standing before the Cartel's sniper.   <br><br>Back at the farm, Jesse muses to Mike about the potential fallout that offing Hank could give, given his connections to both the DEA and to Walt, who would surely stop cooking. Mike asks if Jesse would have a problem if something happened to Hank. Jesse replies that no one cares what he thinks. Outside, a sniper suddenly kills one of Mike's operatives. Furious, Gus walks straight toward the gunfire as bullets continue to explode around him, with it being obvious that the sniper is deliberately missing. Mike calls for him to stop, but Gus instead stalks toward the gunman's position, defiantly raises his arms, and stands in plain view. The shooter turns out to be Gaff, the thug who delivered the Cartel's ultimatum, armed with a Remington 700 ("Problem Dog"). He stops shooting, and smiles.<br><br>That night in his Los Pollos Hermanos office, Gus receives a call. "Tell them my answer is yes," he says in Spanish. Mike and Jesse arrive at the superlab to dispose of the shooting victim's body. Walt sarcastically asks if corpse disposal is a new sideline before launching into a diatribe against Gus, whom he assumes ordered the man dead. Mike in response tells him to shut up and warns him against ever calling the police on one of his men again or he will be killed. Outside the laundry, Jesse asks Mike why Gus pulled "that Terminator shit" at the farm. Mike explains that Gus knew the Cartel wouldn't kill him, because they need his distribution system. Jesse takes this to mean that he and the rest of Gus' operatives are "open season." Mike suggests that Jesse speak with Gus directly about any questions he has.<br><br><br><br>         Skyler and Ted Beneke at the IRS building with Special Agent Picarus.   <br><br>The next day, at the IRS building, Ted is in a meeting with his investigator, Special Agent James Picarus of the Criminal Investigative Division. Ted fumbles his way through his audit until Skyler unexpectedly appears. Dressed in a revealing outfit and playing the 'dumb blonde', Skyler explains Beneke Fabricators' unreported income: As a "paper person," she didn't record electronic payments because there wasn't a physical check. "But the money's there," she assures James as she rubs up to Ted, to imply they're having an affair. James assumes as Skyler intends and buys the act. Outside the building, Skyler says that her stunt spared Ted jail time because 'ignorance' doesn't constitute criminal fraud. He just has to pay the back taxes and penalties—to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars. "I don't have any assets," Ted confesses. When she sees that his car is a used subcompact instead of his BMW, Skyler realizes that he's not kidding.<br><br>That evening, Jesse has dinner at Gus' house. While Gus chops vegetables, Jesse stands next to the pot of stew with the ricin cigarette in his hand, but can't bring himself to go through with it. Over dinner, Gus agrees to address Jesse's concerns, but only after Jesse answers one question: "Can you cook Walter's formula?" Jesse accuses Gus of playing the part of his "buddy" so Jesse can take over after Gus murders Walt. "You kill Mr. White," Jesse says, "you're gonna have to kill me too." Gus calmly responds that is not what he meant, then explains he needs Jesse's help to prevent an all-out war with the Cartel. Jesse is not sure what he means, but listens...<br><br><br><br>         Jesse asking for Walter's help   <br><br>Unable to sleep that night, Skyler looks pensively at the vacuum-sealed bags of money under the house. After work at the superlab the next day, Walt removes a GPS locator that he planted on Jesse's car. At the condo, Walt examines the data, which reveals the trip to Gus' house. Meanwhile, Jesse leaves a message on Walt's voicemail that he has something important to tell Walt. Walt drives to Jesse's house, where Jesse in a panic announces that to avert an all-out war, Gus wants him to travel to Mexico and teach Cartel chemists Walt's formula. Fearing that he'll fail and be killed, Jesse begs Walt to coach him. Walt asks several times if Jesse has seen Gus, which Jesse guiltily denies. Walt grabs the cigarette pack out of Jesse's pocket and finds the ricin still there. "Two hours and eighteen minutes and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?" asks Walt, before producing the GPS device.<br><br>Jesse yells at Walt for bugging him "after all I've done for you." Walt argues that Jesse has only signed Walt's death warrant. "And now you want my advice?" he asks. "Go to Mexico and screw up like I know you will. And wind up in a barrel somewhere!" Jesse snaps and throws the GPS device at Walt, leaving a deep wound on his brow. Walt lunges at Jesse and a vicious, brutal fight ensues. Jesse eventually gains the upper hand, pinning Walt to the floor and repeatedly punching his face, breaking his eyeglasses. We've now caught up with the flash-forward teaser. The fight over, Jesse asks if Walt can walk. When Walt nods yes, Jesse stares at him coldly and says, "Then get the fuck out of here and never come back." As a bloodied Walt exits, he looks over at Jesse, who turns away without a word.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7800017800012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7800017800012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>The Lily of the Valley plant can be seen in Skyler's office before she calls Walt to discuss Walter Jr's birthday party.<br><br> Skyler is seen creating fake receipts, in order to speed up the money laundering process.<br><br>This episode features the longest, and roughest fight between Walt and Jesse.<br><br>Aaron Paul actually grazed Cranston on the tip of the nose while filming the fight scene.<br><br>Gilligan stated he wanted to make their fighting look 'sloppy' by having them putting fingers in each others mouths, breathing heavily, grabbing objects to desperately use to hit one another, etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr. (credit only)<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (credit only)<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br>Christopher Cousins as Ted Beneke<br><br>Maurice Compte as Gaff<br><br>Rob Brownstein as CID Special Agent James Picarus<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br>Ray Campbell as Tyrus<br><br>Scott Sharot as Car Wash Customer<br><br>Eric Steinig as Mike's Security Team Member<br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Christopher King as Chris Mara<br><br>Richard Barela as Carwash Customer<br><br>Viola Valdez as Carwash Customer<br><br><br><br><br><br>Filming Locations<br><br> Hank has Walter come over to plant a tracking device on Gustavos vehicle.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Jesse Pinkman, Mike Ehrmantraut, and Gustavo Fring stand together out in the desert. After a long period of silence, the sound of a single-engine plane can be heard. It lands nearby and they board the plane. Jesse's anxiety during the Mexico-bound flight is palpable. "You can do this," Gus, who is holding a conspicuous giftbox, reassures him.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>At the White Residence, it's Walter White Jr.'s sixteenth birthday. Unable to reach Walter White, Skyler White gives up and surprises Junior on her own with a sensible car parked in the driveway. Though underwhelmed, Walt Jr. politely thanks her, which quietly disappoints Skyler. It's clear Walt Jr. was not expecting a PT Cruiser.<br><br>In his office, Saul Goodman argues with himself. "This is a bad idea," he says, before paging for Ted Beneke to enter. Saul then struggles to inform Ted that his long-lost "Great-Aunt Birgit" from Luxembourg has left him $621,552.33—almost precisely the amount of his debt to the I.R.S. including fines. Ted insists he knows nothing of having a great-aunt, but on hearing the amount of inheritance is all too happy to ignore the details and keep schtum. <br><br><br><br>         Gus, Mike, and Jesse are taken to the superlab   <br><br>In Mexico, Jesse, Mike, and Gus sit blindfolded as Gaff and a leather-jacketed goon drive them to the Cartel's superlab. The chief chemist there takes an instant dislike to a 'too-young' Jesse, maligning him in Spanish as an amateur and a joke. When it becomes apparent that Jesse doesn't know how to synthesize phenylacetic acid, a basic ingredient that any chemistry student could easily synthesize, he becomes ever more indignant. Jesse senses that he's being disrespected and takes charge, telling Gus to "tell this asshole" if he wants to make a superior product, he has to do it Jesse's way. After the chemist responds in English, asking who Jesse thinks he is? Jesse responds that "I'm the guy that your boss brought here to teach you how to do your job", then calls the lab filthy and, channeling Walt, announces that no cook will take place until all contaminants are eliminated and every cook surface scrubbed ("Fly"). "So, stop whining like a little bitch, and do what I say," orders Jesse. They don't like it, but they know Jesse is right about their filthy lab, so they obey and start scrubbing. Both Gus and Mike can hardly contain the surprised pride from beaming forth on their mugs, so quietly impressed they are with Jesse's taking charge. <br><br><br><br>         Walter Jr. meets with his dad   <br><br>Walter Jr. drives in his birthday car to Walt's condo and rings the doorbell. Though inside, Walt doesn't respond until Walter, Jr. leaves a phone message threatening to call 911. Groggy, his face still battered from his fight with Jesse, Walt opens the door in his underwear and lets Walter Jr. in. After lying to his son by attributing his wounds to a fight that came out of his gambling addiction, Walt breaks down tearfully blubbering, "It's all my fault." Walter, Jr. comforts Walt and takes him back to bed. As Walt drifts back into sleep, he mistakenly calls Walt Jr. "Jesse."<br><br>At the Cartel superlab, workers observe and videotape Jesse as he begins the cook alone, lasting all night. Next morning the lead chemist analyzes the finished product in the gas chromatograph. After a tense few moments, the batch tests 96.2 percent pure and Jesse is ecstatic with relief. His product is not as pure as Walt's (99%), though it is still superior to the cartel's. "First of many," congratulates Gaff. Jesse asks what he means. "You're staying," says Gaff. "You belong to the Cartel now," news which has shocked Jesse which he has yet to embrace.<br><br>Saul visits the car wash and shows Skyler a credit report indicating that Ted leased a Mercedes three hours after receiving Walt's money. He won't be able to pay the income tax bill in full—and clearly wasn't going to do so anyway.<br><br><br><br>         Walt shares the story of his father   Walt wakes up late and sees that Walter, Jr. spent the night on the sofa. Apologizing for his behavior, Walt says that after he's dead, he doesn't want Walter, Jr. to remember him as he was the night before. He uses 'strong painkillers chased with beer' as cover for his sorry state. He tells Walt Jr. he wishes he could take it back, telling a story relating his own pity for his hospitalized father. Walt doesn't want his son to remember him like this, "like there was nothing in him." Walter, Jr. disagrees. Remembering his dad the way he was last night wouldn't be that bad. Unlike the past year, at least last night he insists "you were real." Once Walt Jr. leaves, Tyrus Kitt, who was parked nearby, pulls into Walt's driveway and asks Walt "Somewhere you should be?"<br><br>At Beneke Fabricators, Ted tells Skyler, who's dropped in for an explanation, that he's received a "very unexpected cash infusion" and is reopening the business. Skyler argues that he should use the money to pay his tax bill. When Ted responds that his inheritance is his to spend as he pleases, Skyler can't stand it, and blurts out that she was the one who gave him the money.<br><br><br><br>         ¡Salud!   <br><br>Back in Mexico at the Don Eladio's hacienda, Gus stands poolside on the exact spot where his partner Max was murdered years earlier. Calmly, Gus opens a small case and swallows one pill, which seems to have no immediate effect. Jesse complains to Mike about being abandoned in Mexico. Either they're all going home, or none of them are, Mike promises. Don Eladio Vuente appears with several capos, Gaff, and the lead chemist. "I'm so happy you finally came to your senses," says Don Eladio to Gus, referring to the Cartel's ultimatum. After a tense moment, Gus accepts Don Eladio's embrace. Gus introduces Don Eladio to Jesse—his new employee. The lead chemist mocks Jesse's training, but Don Eladio laughs. He taunts back that Jesse cooks superior meth and doesn't care about his training: "...with all your fancy college degrees." Don Eladio then spots the gift box Gus brought on the plane with him, which Gus offers "in honor of our renewed friendship." Delighted by the bottle of Zafiro Añejo premium tequila inside, Don Eladio has a waiter pour shots for everyone except Gaff and Mike. He then takes Jesse's shot back after Gus says that Jesse is an addict and needs to stay sober if he's to do his work. Poised for a toast, Don Eladio stops and warily eyes Gus, waiting for him to drink first. So Gus does drink first, as a show of good faith. After he drinks his shot, Don Eladio does as well, and everyone else follows suit.<br><br>"Enough business," declares Don Eladio, calling for a group of bikini-clad women to join the party. Sometime later, Don Eladio spots Gus sitting by himself and tells him he's not angry with him. He chides Gus for needing Don Eladio to "spank" him every twenty years, and that there's no room for emotion when it comes to business. Gus asks to use the bathroom. Still wary of Gus, Don Eladio has a capo escort him there. Once in the bathroom, Gus neatly lays down a towel in front of the toilet, kneels, and very calmly vomits. Outside, Don Eladio involuntarily drops his cigar and becomes unsteady on his feet. One capo tumbles out of his chair and another loses his balance. Don Eladio's eyes narrow as he realizes they've been poisoned. Gaff moves to assist Don Eladio, but Mike slips in from behind and garrotes Gaff. Gus tidies up and leaves the bathroom, stepping over the corpse of his capo escort as he does. Outside, the stricken Don Eladio looks up and sees Gus, daggers in his eyes, he gasps, "This was you!?" before collapsing into the pool as he lunges for Gus. "Find a gun!" Mike shouts at a stunned Jesse, who pulls one off the nearest dead capo. Mike yanks Don Eladio's rather unique and trademark "evil eye" necklace off of his floating corpse.<br><br><br><br>         The entire Cartel is poisoned   Gus begins to falter, the antidote pill he took earlier not absorbing all of the poison. A crash then echoes inside the house. As Mike and Jesse draw their guns, Gus musters the strength to shout that Don Eladio and his capos are all dead. "You have no one left to fight for. Fill your pockets and leave in peace," Gus warns, "Or fight me and die." Unsure that this will prevent a shootout, Mike and Jesse both catch and prop up Gus and proceed through the house as the waiters and women scurry away with piles of cash in hand. In the driveway, Jesse finds a car with keys in it, and Mike eases Gus inside. Seconds later, Mike is shot in the stomach. Jesse wheels around and fires multiple rounds at Gaff's leather-jacketed thug, killing him. "Get us outta here kid," Mike says, with a tone of resignation, conscious that Jesse has just saved them all and now has total control over the stricken and unprotected Gus. Jesse jumps into the driver's seat and floors it out of the compound.<br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7740017740012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7740017740012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>The title "Salud" (pronounced [ saˈluð ]) is Spanish for "health" and is used as a toast ("¡Salud!").<br><br>Most of the unidentified cartel gangsters killed in this episode are named in the next one, "Crawl Space". Of the 9 capos seen to have been poisoned by the poolside alongside Don Eladio Vuente himself and the cartel chemist Benicio Fuentes, 7 are named: Don Paco, Don Cesar, Don Renaldo, Don Artuno, Don Cisco, Don Luis, and Don Escalada. The lone thug gunned down by Jesse turns out to be Joaquin Salamanca, the grandson of Hector Salamanca.<br><br>The numeral "8" seems to appear conspicuously throughout this episode:<br><br>The bruise on Jesse's face<br><br>The airplane's tail number<br><br>The clouds<br><br>The Whites' house number<br><br>This may be a reference to episode 8 of this season; "Hermanos", where there is a flashback of Gus' partner getting murdered directly in front of him.

In the shot where he gets onto his knees though, the tap can be seen in the background with no water flowing from it.<br><br> When Walt talks with Walt Jr. about his father, he mentions that he was tested for Huntington' s disease when we was a kid and resulted negative. This is not possible, as the disease was mapped in 1983 and the gene identified in 1993.<br><br> In the pool scene where Gus poisons Don Eladio, Jesse is wearing the same leather jacket as Gus's former cook Maximus in the episode Hermanos when he is murdered.<br><br> The lab instrument that supposedly displays the purity of Jesse's cook is actually a Gow-Mac gas chromatograph (the type of instrument referred to by Gale Boetticher in "Box Cutter"), but the readout shown is just a temperature display.<br><br>This is the last episode that Mike sees Gus<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader (credit only)<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader (credit only)<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br>Christopher Cousins as Ted Beneke<br><br>Maurice Compte as Gaff<br><br>Carlo Rota as Benicio Fuentes<br><br>Steven Bauer as Don Eladio Vuente<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br>Ray Campbell as Tyrus<br><br>Tina Parker as Francesca (voice only)<br><br>Rick Ortega as Waiter<br><br>Stephen A.

The building is gone. All that remains is a concrete slab that can be seen from Google Satellite 2017.<br><br> The Don Eladio pool scenes were filmed at a residence in nearby Placitas NM. The home is located at 491 State Hwy 165 Placitas NM. Google Satellite view shows the pool. In the final scene of the episode Jesse drives a wounded Mike & sick Fring out thru some tall triangular stone gates. This is the main entrance visible from the road.<br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br>"Jesse in Mexico" by Dave Porter (as Jesse is taken to the cartel lab)<br><br>"Bang Data" by Bang Data (during the party with the cartel)<br><br>"Tidal Wave" by Thee Oh Sees (during the party with the cartel as the guests begin to pass out)<br><br>"Salud" by Dave Porter (as Gus returns outside and they leave the hacienda)<br><br><br><br>Memorable Quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br>"He had Huntington's disease. It destroys portions of the brain, effects muscle control, and leads to dementia. It's just a nasty disease. It's genetic. Terrified my mother that I might have it, so they ran tests on me when I was a kid, but I came up clean. My father fell very ill when I was four, five. Spent a lot of time in the hospital. My, heh, my mother would tell me so many stories about my father. I mean, she would talk about him all the time. I knew about his personality, how he treated people, I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked; medium rare, just like you. I knew things about my father, I had a lot of information. It was because people would tell me these things. They would paint this picture of my father for me and I always pretended that was who I saw too, that I remembered. But it was all a lie. In truth, I only have one real actual memory of my father. It must have been right before he died. My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him. And I remember the smell in there. The chemicals. It was as if they used every single cleaning product they could find in a fifty mile radius, like they didn't want you smelling the sick people. There was this stench of Lysol and bleach, you could just feel it coating your lungs. Anyway, there lying on the bed is my father. And he's all... he's all twisted up. My mom, she puts me on her lap, she's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at him, but really he just scares me. And he's looking right at me, but I can't even be sure he knows who I am. And your grandmother is talking, trying to be cheerful as she does, but the only thing I could remember is him breathing. There was this...this rattling sound, like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can. Like there was nothing in him. Anyway, that is the only real memory that I have of my father. I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Doctors and nurses hastily prepare medical equipment until a phone call prompts them to wheel a stretcher out of the room. Upon their exit it's revealed that they are working in a fully equipped tent inside an abandoned warehouse. A car comes racing toward them, frantically honking its horn until it comes to a halt and its driver, Jesse Pinkman, jumps out. The medical staff put the unconscious Gustavo Fring onto the stretcher and rush him into the tent, leaving behind the severely injured Mike Ehrmantraut, despite Jesse's desperate calls of "what about him, huh!?"<br><br>In the tent, the doctors and nurses focus intently on saving Gus from his self-induced poisoning. Jesse stumbles in carrying Mike, who is bleeding profusely, and shouts angrily, "This man needs help!" The head doctor, Dr. Barry Goodman, shoots back, "This man pays my salary" in reference to Gus, and continue ignoring Mike... <br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Walt and Tyrus in the superlab   <br><br>Walter White cooks another batch of meth alone in the superlab with Tyrus Kitt hovering over his shoulder. He asks about Jesse and what should be done with Hank Schrader; as usual, Tyrus is a man of few words. When they weigh the meth, Walt tries to add 0.02 pounds to the total in a failed attempt to implicate Tyrus in stealing the product; which Tyrus immediately reweighs and corrects, much to Walt's chagrin. Later, Walt sits with Hank in his car while Hank patiently watches Gus's chicken farm. There was a big cartel incident in Mexico, Hank says, with many bodies, which causes Walt to worry about Jesse. Hank brings up the subject of Walt's face, which still has many cuts and bruises from the fight with Jesse, and assures him that if he's in over his head with his gambling, he is the guy to talk to.<br><br>Back in Mexico, Mike is asleep and receiving a blood transfusion. The whole scenario was planned out from the beginning, with the doctors prepared with the medical history and correct blood types for the trio. Jesse's amazed that they even had bags of his blood-type ready, as well as info on his allergies. The doctor says Mike will need at least a week of rest before he can travel, so Gus tells Jesse he'll send for Mike later and they set off to leave without him. <br><br>It's a six-mile walk north to Texas. Gus congratulates Jesse on his performance in the ordeal and says he's proved he can run the superlab on his own. "Let Mr. White go," Jesse tells him, but Gus objects saying that just won't do. Jesse insists that in that case they have a problem, as he won't cook if Walt is killed.<br><br>At home, Skyler White, entering the kitchen with groceries, discovers a voicemail from Ted Beneke. Ted states that he gave the situation more thought, but has decided he "can't do it." At Ted's house, Ted gives Skyler a check for the full amount she gave him previously (minus, she points out, the amount he spent on the new Mercedes), but she tries to convince him to pay the IRS with this money instead. Skyler knows that if the IRS investigates Ted, they'll investigate her as well, possibly finding out about the "gambling winnings" used to buy the car wash. She cannot, however, tell Ted why he must comply. He says the amount she gave him isn't enough to save his life from ruin anyway, which sounds like blackmail to Skyler who thinks he's attempting to extort a larger amount off her. Distressed after the meeting, Skyler calls Saul Goodman for a little help.<br><br>Gus and Jesse visit Don Hector Salamanca at the nursing home, where Gus gloats about murdering Don Eladio and all the other high-ranking members of the cartel. He places Eladio's eye necklace into Hector's pocket. Just then Jesse walks in and Gus points him out as the man that shot his grandson, Joaquin Salamanca, during their escape. Don Hector recognises Jesse ("Grilled")  ("Bit by a Dead Bee"), and as his eyes fill with tears of rage and sadness, Gus relishes in reminding him that Joaquin was his last remaining male family member. Then strikes the final blow, that the Salamanca name will therefore now die with him. His revenge for Max's killing finally complete, he asks Hector once again if now he'll look him in the eye. Hector, as always, steadfastly refuses, but can't hide being visibly crushed. Gus walks out triumphant. <br><br><br><br>         The collision between the vehicles   <br><br>Walt again sees Tyrus watching Hank's home as he goes to pick up Hank for another day of watching Gus's farm. As they drive, however, Hank unexpectedly asks Walt to go to the industrial laundry where the superlab is hidden. Hank tells Walt about the connections he's found between the laundry, Madrigal Electromotive, Los Pollos Hermanos, Gus, and Gale Boetticher. "In an industrial laundry, we've got one hell of a place to hide a meth lab," Hank observes. Walt, taken by surprise and in a total panic, drives past the laundry's entrance then deliberately causes a car accident by turning into oncoming traffic.<br><br>Back at the Schrader house, Hank, in a neck brace, sits eating frozen yogurt with Skyler and Walter White Jr. as Marie Schrader and Walt enter the room. The accident added a new set of wounds to Walt's already battered face. Hank announces that he's ordered a "gimp mobile," a new car with hand controls, so he doesn't have to get friends and family to drive him around. Walt looks concerned at this new development. <br><br>Saul calls Skyler to inform her that he's dealing with Ted using his "A-Team", Huell Babineaux and Patrick Kuby (who acted earlier as the fake EPA inspector in Skyler's plot to get Bogdan to sell his car wash to the Whites ("Open House")). The A-Team visit Ted at his home and force him to write a check to the IRS for $617,226.31, telling him they will remain at his house until the check clears. When Ted tries to run for it, he trips over a rug (that he'd earlier in the episode similarly tripped over) and crashes headfirst into a wall. The A-Team later confirm with Saul that at least the check was in the post and that what happened to Ted was an "act of God" beyond their control.<br><br>Walt returns to work at the superlab by being concealed among dirty laundry, which he bitterly complains about. Although Walt took four days off due to the accident with Hank, he soon discovers that someone had been cooking in the lab during that time: it must've been Jesse.<br><br>That evening, Jesse hangs out at his house with Andrea Cantillo and Brock Cantillo, playing the video-game Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) when Walt shows up. He implores Jesse to not cook on his own, pointing out that he'll be killed if rendered unnecessary. Jesse becomes furious and points out that the last time he came to him for help, Walt wished him stuffed dead in a barrel and buried somewhere in the desert.  He then reprimands Walt for becoming a risk, "You brought your brother-in-law to our lab. What the hell is wrong with you?"<br><br>When Jesse goes back inside, Tyrus appears and tazes Walt into submission. He is covered with a hood and taken out to the desert where he meets with Gus, who tells Walt he's fired. Walt deduces that Jesse is preventing Gus from eliminating him, declaring "If you could kill me, I'd already be dead." Gus snidely replies it's only a matter of time. Then informs him Hank needs to be dealt with, and warns Walt that if he interferes he'll kill his entire family, including his infant daughter. Walt's then cut loose but left to make his own way out of the desert. <br><br>Afterward, Walt frantically presses Saul for the phone number of the guy who makes people disappear. He gives him the number, but warns that it'll cost at least $500,000 in cash for four people, (not including his commission of course.) Walt also asks a very reluctant Saul to give him a one-hour head start and then warn the DEA that Hank's life is in danger.<br><br><br><br>         Walt searches for the money   <br><br>At home, Walt scrambles into the meter room and desperately searches for the money in the crawl space below, only to discover that there's not enough as a large sum of the cash is missing. Skyler enters the room with a look of fright on her face, peering down at Walt in the crawl space as he frustratingly demands she tell him where the missing money has gone. She admits that she gave the money to Ted to protect the family; nervously trying to explain herself to a panicking Walt. Walt lets out a violent scream and begins to cry, until his tears abruptly turn into maniacal laughter. The phone starts to ring, several times before the caller begins to record a message: It's Marie, who is in sheer panic because the DEA received a tip that the Cartel is going to attack Hank again. Skyler approaches the phone and after calming herself, picks it up and starts assuring her sister she's there. Back in the crawl space, Walt has stopped laughing and is now just lying on his back staring aimlessly up through the hole in the floor ... as the camera pans away, rising up towards the roof to blackout.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>When Gus and Jesse leave the hospital, Gus says 'vamonos' meaning they are leaving, but could be a reference to Walt's front to his eventual drug empire 'Vamonos Pest'.<br><br>Hank tells Walt that much of his job involves waiting. This is like what Mike told Jesse in "Cornered". <br><br>The little white car is Walt's after the Pontiac Aztek is damaged. It can be seen at Jesse's house when Walt visits and then it's out in the desert (Tyrus and his thug walk to the other car).<br><br>Ted trips over his carpet early in the episode, foreshadowing his later fall caused by the same carpet.<br><br>Once again, a character is blindfolded and then not killed. This goes back to what Jesse told Mike about the thief in "Bullet Points", as well as what Walt and Jesse did to Saul upon their first meeting ("Better Call Saul"). The hood was apparently meant to scare Walt.<br><br>Gus's actions towards Walt in this episode contradict his previous statement in "Green Light" about fear not being an effective motivator.<br><br>The vacuum model used as a code for the man who makes people disappear, the "Hoover MaxExtract Pressure Pro Model 60", is a real product.<br><br>When Walt arrives at Jesse's house, he and Brock are playing the video game, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)<br><br> When Walt and Hank are driving to the industrial laundry, a sign can be seen outside of the car reading: "A-One Collision". - This business shares the A-1 name with the car-wash, and is a real business in Albuquerque, NM.<br><br> References to other media:<br><br> Due to his facial cuts and bruises, Hank remarks that Walt showed up looking like "Macho Camacho." <br><br> Hank calls Walt "Kojak" because he's bald and talking about how the chicken farm is the best place to investigate.<br><br> Hank calls Walt "Mr. Magoo" for not seeing the oncoming traffic that hit them.<br><br> Hank describes the web of connections surrounding Gus as being like Three Days of the Condor.<br><br> Marie describes Hank and Walt's sleuthing as a Hardy Boys routine.<br><br> Hector is watching the conclusion of The Bridge on the River Kwai.<br><br> Saul calls his guys "The A-Team".<br><br><br><br> The final shot where Walter stares exasperatedly out of the crawl space bears resemblance to the shot of Jesse on his first heroin trip in "Mandala". Both the shots feature surreal photography with the camera rising impossibly high looking down, conveying the intense feelings both characters were experiencing.<br><br> The final shot also bears a striking resemblance to the last shot of the whole series in "Felina", with Walter staring straight up into the camera while lying motionless on the ground. This has led many fans to believe that this is the point in the show where the real Walter White 'died' and Heisenberg took over for good.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br>Mark Margolis as Hector Salamanca<br><br>Christopher Cousins as Ted Beneke<br><br>Emily Rios as Andrea Cantillo<br><br>Bill Burr as Patrick Kuby<br><br>JB Blanc as Barry Goodman<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br>Ray Campbell as Tyrus<br><br>Lavell Crawford as Huell<br><br>Tina Parker as Francesca<br><br>Ian Posada as Brock<br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Christopher King as Chris Mara<br><br>Grizelda Quintana as Car Wash Attendant<br><br><br><br><br><br>Filming Locations<br><br> The episode opens with Jesse looking over Mike in a makeshift hospital, the end of the scene shows him walking away from the building that has a stepped roof, and a concrete ramp leading up to it.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Walter White and Skyler White frantically pack their luggage in their bedroom and discuss preparing Walter White Jr.'s belongings. As DEA agents arrive at the White Residence to take them into protective custody at Hank and Marie Schrader's, Walt tells Skyler that the hitman is after him, not Hank and that his presence will only make the situation more dangerous. Skyler frantically asks Walt, "How long till you're safe. 'Till you've worked it out?"  Walt can only answer, "There was a way out. But not any longer." She very reluctantly leaves him behind as she takes the baby to her sister's.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Walt sits at home, alone, with his .38 snub at his side, anticipating the worst. He mulls over his options, spinning the gun three times on its side as he does so. The first two times the barrel of the gun stops pointing straight at Walt, while the third points at his nearby flowerpot wherein a lily-of-the-valley is planted. Walt continues his musings in sullen, hopeless silence.<br><br>At the Schrader residence, Walter White Jr. complains that Skyler White didn't do enough to convince Walt to come, and that his father is too stubborn to realize his own life is more important than a car wash. Hank calms everyone down and convinces Steven Gomez that his wild goose hunt against Gustavo Fring led to the death threat. Gomez, tired of being badgered, finally agrees to investigate.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse and Tyrus in the superlab during Gomez's investigation   <br><br>Gomez arrives at the industrial laundry and talks the foreman into letting him search the facility - now, with just two men, or later when he comes back with a warrant and twenty officers. When the foreman agrees, Gomez brings out a drug dog to sniff out the place, but to no avail. Beneath the facility, Jesse Pinkman and Tyrus Kitt wait silently. Gus calls Jesse and tells him that this is why he couldn't trust Walt. Jesse says he sympathizes, but again insists if anything serious happens to Walt, he won't cook. Gus answers that he'll make an appropriate retaliation and hangs up. Gomez leaves, with just some photographs, and Jesse continues his cook. Later, a laundry truck drops Jesse off by his car parked on the side of an abandoned street. He attempts to call Walt with no success but does check his voicemail only to find several panicked calls from Saul Goodman.<br><br>He goes to Saul's office where his new bodyguard Huell Babineaux pats him down for weapons. Saul gives Jesse the rest of his money that he had stored, and tells him that he is hitting the road because he fears for his own safety after Gus threatened Walt's entire family. Jesse is shocked at the news, wanting to know when this threat happened. Hank frustratingly looks at the "squeaky clean" photos from the industrial laundry, upset that the investigation led to no avail. Skyler tries to offer him silent condolences, and steps outside to smoke a cigarette.<br><br>Jesse sits on his couch at home, thinking over the intense developments of the day. He receives a phone call and rushes to the hospital where Brock Cantillo has been admitted to the emergency room. His condition is getting worse and worse, and when Andrea Cantillo goes in to see him in the pediatric ICU, Jesse steps outside to smoke a cigarette. He notices his cigarette with ricin is missing, in a desperate panic smashes his entire cigarette pack searching, then runs inside to tell Andrea that Brock may have been poisoned with ricin. Andrea begs him to tell her what's going on, but he can only apologize and hurriedly runs off.<br><br>At Walt's house, Jesse knocks on the door. Walt has barricaded himself in, but lets Jesse in. They talk about Walt's situation. Walt lays his gun down and as he frantically checks from window to window, Jesse picks it up and points it at him. Walt notices and tries to talk Jesse into lowering the gun, but Jesse is convinced that Walt has poisoned Brock, insisting Walt admit why. Walt talks Jesse through the evidence, attempting to convince him that he would not have anything to gain by killing the child. Suddenly Walt pauses, then falls into panicked laughter as he realizes that Gus has arranged all of this so it would be Jesse who kills Walt. He explains it all and gets Jesse to believe it. Jesse finally lowers the gun and before he leaves, Walt convinces Jesse to help him kill Gus.<br><br>That night at the hospital, Jesse continually attempts to enter the ICU, but is stopped by the nurses since Andrea refuses to let him in. The next morning, Tyrus roughly awakens Jesse in the waiting area and orders him to return to the lab to continue his now overdue cooking. He refuses and when Tyrus attempts to strong-arm him into moving, Jesse calls security on him. He then sends a text message to Walt, who is preparing a pipe bomb in his kitchen. Later, Tyrus meets Jesse again in the hospital and tells him Gus is waiting to talk to him. Gus is at first insistent that they're on a schedule, but when he realizes that Jesse might suspect him in the poisoning, he tells Jesse to wait in the hospital for however long Brock needs to recover. Jesse seemingly manages to lie to Gus that he doesn't know how Brock was poisoned.<br><br><br><br>         Gus and his bodyguards walking to his car   <br><br>Gus leaves the hospital and walks toward his car. From a far-off rooftop, Walt holds the detonator and watches with binoculars. As Gus nears his car, he suddenly pauses, instead moving towards the ledge and looking out over the rooftops from the parking garage. He surveys the rooftops in silence as Walt, puzzled by Gus' actions, scrambles down so as not to be seen. Gus ultimately decides to walk away from his car than take the chance. Walt, detonator still in hand, is left wondering how Gus could've possibly known about the bomb - he looks exhausted, panicked and helpless.   <br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>This is the third episode of Breaking Bad to be directed by Vince Gilligan.<br><br>This is the first and only episode to be directed but not written by Vince Gilligan.<br><br>The hospital in this episode sports a nod to the Breaking Bad logo all across its tiled floor.<br><br>In this episode Jesse accuses Walt of poisoning Brock, and Walt gives a highly believable denial, one far more convincing than Walt's ability to lie. It is later revealed (at the end of "Face Off") that he did in fact poison Brock.

I have lived under the threat of death for a year now, and because of that, I’ve made choices…. I alone should suffer the consequences of those choices, no one else. And those consequences–they’re coming. No more prolonging the inevitable."<br><br>―Walter explaining to Skyler that he is the real target and that he can not just flee.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jesse: "Hey–Stop laughing. Stop laughing!"<br><br>Walter: "I have been waiting. I have been waiting all day, waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me–and it’s you. Who do you know who’s okay with using children, Jesse? Who do you know who has allowed children to be murdered? Hm? Gus! He has–he has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn, and now the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent, and boy he’s got that now. He’s got it. And not only does he have that, but he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him."<br><br>Jesse: "Only you and I knew about the ricin!"<br><br>Walter: "No! You don’t even believe that–Gus’ cameras everywhere. Please. Listen to yourself. No. He has known everything all along. Where were you today? In the lab? And you don’t think it’s possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on! Don’t you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that he’s wanted. You’re his cook now. You’re the cook, and you have proven that you can run a lab without me, and now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it! It’s brilliant! So go ahead. Go ahead. If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead. Put a bullet in my head and kill me right now. Do it! Do it!"<br><br>―Jesse and Walter in Walt’s living room<br><br><br><br>vteBreaking Bad : EpisodesSeason 1#1 Pilot • #2  Cat's in the Bag... • #3 ...and the Bag's in the River • #4 Cancer Man • #5 Gray Matter • #6 Crazy Handful of Nothin' • #7 A No-Rough-Stuff-Type DealSeason 2#1 Seven Thirty-Seven • #2 Grilled • #3 Bit by a Dead Bee • #4 Down • #5 Breakage • #6 Peekaboo • #7 Negro y Azul • #8 Better Call Saul • #9 4 Days Out • #10 Over • #11 Mandala • #12 Phoenix • #13 ABQSeason 3#1 No Más • #2 Caballo Sin Nombre • #3 I.F.T. • #4 Green Light • #5 Más • #6 Sunset • #7 One Minute • #8 I See You • #9 Kafkaesque • #10 Fly • #11 Abiquiú • #12 Half Measures • #13 Full MeasureSeason 4#1 Box Cutter • #2 Thirty-Eight Snub • #3 Open House • #4 Bullet Points • #5 Shotgun • #6 Cornered • #7 Problem Dog • #8 Hermanos • #9 Bug • #10 Salud • #11 Crawl Space • #12 End Times • #13 Face OffSeason 5#1 Live Free or Die • #2 Madrigal • #3 Hazard Pay • #4 Fifty-One • #5 Dead Freight • #6 Buyout • #7 Say My Name • #8 Gliding Over All • #9 Blood Money • #10 Buried • #11 Confessions • #12 Rabid Dog • #13 To'hajiilee • #14 Ozymandias • #15 Granite State • #16 FelinaMeanings of the title names of every episode<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Retrieved from "https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/End_Times?oldid=86867"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Categories:<br><br><br><br><br><br>Breaking Bad episodes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsourced quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Season 4 episodes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Languages: <br><br><br><br>Deutsch<br><br><br><br>Español<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>window.adslots2.push(["TOP_RIGHT_BOXAD"]);<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fan Feed<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>More Breaking Bad Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1<br><br>Patrick Kuby<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>2<br><br>Walter White<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>3<br><br>Jesse Pinkman<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explore Wikis<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Sacred Lies Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Glitchtale Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Christmas Specials Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explore<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Games<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Movies<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>TV<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wikis<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Follow Us<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Overview<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>About<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Careers<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Press<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Contact<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Terms of Use<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Privacy Policy<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Global Sitemap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Local Sitemap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Community<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Community Central<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Support<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fan Contributor Program<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>WAM Score<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Help<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Can't find a community you love?

                        <div class="ui message"><p>After Gustavo Fring turns from his car and leaves the parking garage, Walter White rushes to disarm the bomb and remove it from the vehicle. He then enters the hospital and talks with Jesse Pinkman, asking if he can think of any other place to catch Gus off guard. As they talk, two detectives approach Jesse and take him to interrogate him about the ricin hint.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         The policemen interrogate Jesse.   <br><br>Detectives Kalanchoe and Munn interrogate Jesse and he asks to call his lawyer, Saul Goodman. At the same time, Walt breaks into Saul's office to try and find a way to contact him since he fled. Saul's secretary extorts him for $20,000, and when he balks at the amount, $25,000 for the information. He returns to his house to get the money but, realizing that Gus may have staked the place out, parks down the street and sends his unwitting neighbor, Rebecca Simmons, to check the house for him (he tells her that the family is on vacation and Walter White Jr. thinks he left the stove on). His suspicions are right; shortly after she enters the house, a pair of gunmen, Harris Boivin and Raymond Martinez, quietly sneak out through the back gate. After a few brief minutes, the neighbour leaves, and Walt sneaks in the backdoor into the crawl space to get the $25,000 and narrowly avoids the hitman pair who enter shortly after him.<br><br>Back at the police station, Saul enters the interrogation room, sending the detectives out the room, and confers with Jesse - does he have any info that might help Walt reach Gus. Jesse tells him to pass on the only info he can think of —that Gus visits Hector Salamanca at the Casa Tranquila nursing home. Walt ponders this information and decides to use Hector's hatred of Gus to his advantage. He meets with Hector. After Walt has left, Hector calls a nurse and spells out a message: "Need DEA". Later, Steven Gomez visits Hank Schrader, who is still under heavy DEA protection, and informs him that Hector has important cartel information and will only speak with Hank. At the DEA office, Hector spells out "S-U-C-K-M-Y" and "F-U-C-" before Hank calls it off and sends Hector back to the nursing home, with Hank quipping "Well, at least he didn't shit himself this time." Tyrus Kitt, who is keeping an eye on Hank, sees Hector being loaded into the van at the police headquarters. Tyrus then informs Gus that Hector was acting as an informant to the DEA, playing into his and Walt's trap. After Hector is returned to the nursing home, Tyrus enters and sweeps the place for bugs and cameras. The police inform Jesse that ricin was not found in Brock Cantillo's blood, so luckily for him he's free to go.<br><br>On the sidewalk, Jesse is tazed and abducted by two of Gus's men. Tyrus calls Gus to report both Jesse's kidnapping and Hector's betrayal to the DEA. He willingly offers to take care of the situation with Hector himself, but Gus vetoes his suggestion, saying "I do this". Fring leaves for the nursing home. <br><br>He arrives shortly thereafter and waits in the parking lot while Tyrus checks the room for unexpected surprises. Upon getting the "all clear" signal, Gus walks into the nurse home and enters Hector's room. Gus berates Hector for his supposed "cowardice", calling him  "a crippled little rata (rat)". Tyrus prepares a syringe and hands it to Gus. "Last chance to look at me," Fring pridefully says, before letting out a sarcastic sigh. As he brings the needle closer to Hector's arm, Hector actually, for the first time in many years, looks dead into Gus's eyes with a gaze of remorse. Gus is shocked, though Hector's expression soon changes to a face of wrath and starts sounding his bell repeatedly. <br><br><br><br>         Gus Fring's demise.   Gus, at first, is bewildered but soon, alerted by the blinking of a tiny light, realizes that Hector has a bomb fitted to the wheelchair, rigged to blow up by ringing the bell. He shoots up out of his seat and yells, but the bomb explodes, blowing down the door to Hector's room and sending debris into the hallway of the nursing home. Gus calmly walks out of the destroyed room and adjusts his tie, seemingly unharmed by the explosion. But then nurses run up, shocked with horror: the camera swings to Gus' right side, and we see that the right half of Gus' face has been blown off by the bomb, leaving his skull, jaw, and brain exposed. He falls to the floor, dead.<br><br>In a long-term parking lot outside the Albuquerque airport, Walt is listening to the radio news report which is breaking the story about the explosion. The only salient detail at the time is that "as many as three people may have been killed." Smiling, Walt pulls out of the lot.<br><br>Down in the superlab, Jesse prepares for another batch while one of the thugs who kidnapped him sits around monitoring him with a gun. The lab's elevator sounds and the thug forces Jesse to handcuff himself to one of the chemical tanks while he goes to check it out. Upon unlocking the elevator door, the thug's partner appears with Walt popping up from behind him and shooting both men. Jesse hears three gun shots and sees Walt walk around the corner; the blood of the two thugs spattered on his face. "Gus is dead," he says to Jesse. "We've got work to do."<br><br>The two then open every chemical container in the lab, flooding the floor with a dangerous mix, then rig a Christmas light timer to a frayed wire and exit the lab. They wipe down the machinery for prints and pull the fire alarm as the chemicals ignite downstairs. Walt yells "Vamonos" to the laundry workers and as they flee, the superlab lab below explodes.<br><br><br><br>         "I won."   <br><br>Walt and Jesse meet on the roof of the hospital's parking garage. Jesse tells Walt that Brock is going to recover, and that it was not ricin, but Lily of the Valley that poisoned Brock - a flower with poisonous berries that children sometimes think to be edible. Walt reassures him that Gus needed to die nonetheless. Walt calls Skyler, who has learned about the nursing home explosion on TV and, weary of the reply, asks if he had anything to do with it. He replies simply: "I won". Eyes widening, Skyler wordlessly reacts with fear and horror, realizing what her husband is capable of. Walt hangs up the phone and drives away. As he passes Gus' Volvo, still parked in the hospital parking lot, he smiles as the camera focuses on the 'Los Pollos Hermanos' air-freshner hanging from its rear-view mirror. In Walt's backyard, the camera slowly pans towards a large flower pot where a plant with delicate hanging bell-shaped white flowers is growing. The label pegged between its leaves reads : "Lily of the Valley."<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7780017780012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7780017780012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br> This episode has the outstanding score of 9.8/10 on IMDb. This is the third highest rated episode of the series, after "Ozymandias" and "Felina" (9.9/10 each) as of November 25, 2017.<br><br>Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis) is indeed a poisonous plant, where all parts of the plant - from its red berries / rhizomes / leaves / stems / to its intoxicatingly scented little white flowers - are toxic with over 40 cardiac glycosides. ... The reveal of the plant is silent proof that Walt was in fact lying to Jesse in the previous episode, and did indeed betray Jesse in order to manipulate him.  <br><br>Another LOTV legend claims the plant sprang from the blood of St. Leonard of Noblac as he battled a dragon. Even this "battling of a dragon" theme is nicely analogous to Walt's battling of his dragon - Gus. <br><br>In his final moments, Gus Fring bears a striking resemblance to the Batman villain Two-Face. This is likely a tongue-in-cheek reference to Fring's double life and treacherous nature.<br><br>The episode's title refers to the final showdown between Walt and Gus, but can also be seen as a play on words regarding Gus' demise - where half of his face is burnt off.<br><br>Gustavo Fring is the first main character to die.<br><br>Jesse mentions the medical show House, M.D. while he is being questioned by the police. House often featured patients whose symptoms were the result of poison derived from an unusual source - ergot, organophosphates, toad eggs and methyl bromide were all featured, but neither ricin nor Lily of the Valley ever were.<br><br>The woman who plays the Whites' neighbor, Rebecca Simmons, is Vince Gilligan's mother, Gail Gilligan.<br><br>Extended on home video. The episode was a few minutes too long, and the clip of Gilligan's mother was cut to shorten the time. It was only seen on the original premiere of the episode. The scene was restored on the home video release.<br><br>The scene where Walter drops his gun after killing the men in the lab mirrors the scene where Gus drops the boxcutter in Box Cutter.<br><br>Walt employs the old proverbial tactic of "The enemy of my enemy is my friend," when he decides to use Hector Salamanca to help him kill Gus. Hank later uses the same tactic when he teams up with Jesse in an attempt to arrest Walt.<br><br>The music in the scene where Gus walks towards the Casa Traquila nursing home is "Goodbye" by Apparat. Appropriately, the Apparat album on which this track can be found is called "The Devil's Walk".<br><br>A photograph can be seen of Hector with twin infants and a psychotic-looking child, these being Marco, Leonel and  Tuco when they were young.<br><br>Erika Viking was a real DJ on Coyote 102.5 at the time of filming.<br><br>This is the third episode to be written and directed by Vince Gilligan, after "Pilot" and "Full Measure".<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring<br><br>Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut (credit only)<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Mark Margolis as Hector Salamanca<br><br>Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez<br><br>Michael Shamus Wiles as ASAC George Merkert<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ray Campbell as Tyrus Kitt<br><br>Myra Turley as Caregiver<br><br>Gonzalo Menendez as Detective Kalanchoe<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Tina Parker as Francesca<br><br>Jason Douglas as Detective Munn<br><br>Matt Berlin as DEA Agent<br><br>Kevin Wiggins as Gus' Operative<br><br>Augusta Meyers as News Reporter<br><br><br><br><br><br>Lorenzita Anaya as Little Old Lady<br><br>Marty Smith as Bingo Caller<br><br>Erica Viking as Radio DJ #1<br><br>Steve Ruiz as Radio DJ #2<br><br><br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Ricardo Andres as Hospital Patient<br><br>Christopher King as Chris Mara<br><br>J.T.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>At a counter in a Denny's restaurant, a man served his breakfast: bacon, two eggs sunnyside up and hashbrowns. The man breaks his bacon strips in half, then arranges the pieces into the number 52, referencing a White family birthday tradition. This man is revealed to be Walter White -- in deteriorating health, sporting a different pair of glasses, full head of hair, an unkempt beard and no wedding band. We are a year into the future.<br><br>Walt gives a fake name (Lambert, which is Skyler and Marie's maiden name) and bears a false ID from New Hampshire. Excusing himself to the bathroom, he trades an envelope of cash for a set of keys in the bathroom with Lawson, his previous gun dealer. Lawson asks Walt for his word that "it" won't be crossing the border. Walt assures him that "it" won't be leaving town. Before exiting the bathroom, Walt lets out a slight cough and pops a pill.<br><br>Leaving a generous $100 tip under his breakfast plate for the waitress, Walt exits the diner and locates the car that the keys belong to. Opening the trunk, "it" is revealed to be an M60 machine gun with ammunition and a printed instruction manual. Walt looks around cautiously, then puts his bag in with the gun and slams the trunk shut.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Returning home following the explosion at Casa Tranquila, Walt disposes of all evidence from the pipe bomb, then quickly remembers to also throw out the potted Lily of the Valley plant from which he took the toxin used on Brock. Walt Jr. and Skyler return shortly thereafter and, although Jr. is excited that Gus's death means Hank will be labeled a hero, Skyler is now terrified of her husband and warily tells him so. Walt takes a drink of celebratory whiskey, but suddenly remembers the security cameras inside the destroyed superlab. Meanwhile, Hank and Gomez survey the charred remains of the superlab, noting that it was identical to Gale Boetticher's designs. Gomez remarks that the corpses -- who were shot by Walt -- are unidentifiable due to the fire. Hank notices the remains of the security camera with great interest.<br><br><br><br>         The meeting in the desert   <br><br>In Mexico, Mike feeds chickens outside the temporary medical clinic where he had been recuperating from the shootout with the cartel. After learning of Gus' fate, Mike furiously drives off to go kill Walt. As Walt, Mike, and Jesse cross paths in the desert, Mike immediately pulls a gun on Walt, determined to shoot him. Jesse shields Walt and states that Mike will need to kill him too, causing him to lower his pistol. They ask Mike where Gus kept the footage from the security camera -- reminding him that he has an interest in helping them, as the footage would also implicate him. After a heated argument, the three agree to find a way to destroy Gus's laptop, which Mike tells them was kept in his office at Los Pollos Hermanos.<br><br>Mike fakes a call to the Albuquerque Police, finding out that the laptop had already been placed in their evidence room. As Mike and Walt argue back and forth about how to break into the evidence room, Jesse's suggests that they use a giant magnet. Acting on this idea, the trio meet with Old Joe at his junkyard to use the electromagnet he uses to move wrecked cars. Which they then hook up to 42 car batteries inside a moving truck. Mike's not convinced about this plan and just wants to leave them to it. However, Jesse convinces him that he's certain it will work, but that it's a three man job, so begs him not to leave. After some arrangements they do a prelim' test out in the yard and as their juiced-up magnet utterly wipes their test laptop, Mike (and all) are equal parts surprised and elated to see it work so successfully. They congratulate Jesse for his fine idea.   <br><br><br><br>         Ted in the hospital   <br><br>Saul visits Skyler at the car wash to inform her that Ted Beneke had an accident. She fears, thinking Saul's announcing his death, but he reassures her that Ted has just woken up from a coma. She visits Ted at the hospital, where he is in a spinal neck brace being treated for severe head trauma. Skyler, her face etched with guilt, can hardly find the words of apology she needs to say, whilst Ted's eyes seem to mirror some of the fear that's been filling Skyler's lately, but his ironically for the Skyler that set the 'heavies' on him. With that in mind, and mentioning he has a family, he promises her he will never speak a word of the events that transpired. "Good," Skyler replies.<br><br>That night, Mike hot-wires the gate into the APD parking lot. Walt and Jesse drive the magnet-equipped truck alongside the building to the wall outside the evidence room. The magnet disables the guard's computer, alerting the police. In desperation, Walt cranks the magnet up to its maximum voltage, sending a force so strong it tips the truck over. The police security guard finds the evidence room half destroyed by the magnet, surprised to see all the metallic evidence stuck to the centre of one wall, and sends officers outside to apprehend the crooks, but Walt and Jesse escape with Mike in his car, leaving the truck behind. Mike is dubious of the ploy's success, wary of any left behind evidence. Walt insists he made sure no fingerprints or traceable evidence was left behind. Mike still not convinced, argues why he should take it on faith or be so certain that it worked. Walt, sitting smugly in the backseat, cockily responds, it worked "because I say so." To which Mike responds with just a long icy state into the rearview mirror back at Walt. <br><br><br><br>         The note behind the photo   The police officers clean up the evidence room and find a smashed picture frame wherein they find account numbers of a bank in the Cayman Islands annotated behind a picture of Gus and Max Arciniega - (possibly not have been so quickly found, if at all, had the frame not been smashed in the whole magnet turmoil.) <br><br>Walt visits Saul's office where Saul explains what transpired in regards to Skyler giving Ted $600,000. Walt reprimands Saul for allowing his wife to give such a large amount to a man she was sleeping with. Saul exasperated by an inappreciative ungrateful Walt, attempts to sever all ties, insisting "He's done" - but Walt backs him into a corner in the office and menacingly responds, "We're done when I say we're done."<br><br>Walt returns home to a frightened Skyler and tells her that he knows what has happened to Ted, why she did it and that he forgives her. She hesitantly accepts his hug.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7780017780012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7780017780012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>This is the first episode in which the opening titles have been corrected to reflect the proper electron configuration of barium (Ba), 2-8-18-18-8-2.

Additionally, the motto is a foreshadowing that Walter's fate might either be a life of freedom, or death.<br><br>Walt's New Hampshire car is an older model Volvo, which happens to be the same brand of car Gustavo Fring drove.<br><br>Mike mentions that the police evidence room will have Halon, because it doesn't destroy evidence. Halon fire extinguishers accomplish this by not producing any type of residue afterwards.<br><br>Old Joe references String theory (a theory which is a candidate for a "theory of everything") and the "god particle" which is another name for the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson was actually discovered just 11 days prior to the airing of this episode; it was just a theoretical particle up until July 4, 2012.<br><br>The episode correctly shows the effects of a magnetic field on a laptop or computer. It would have little effect on the laptop components (barring metal reinforcements, which can be attracted), but will destroy a magnetic hard drive. Thankfully for the trio, Gus' laptop was an older model that doesn't use solid-state drives (flash memory), which are immune to strong magnetic fields.<br><br> The behavior of the magnet inside the truck and the tipping is correct as well. As electromagnets are not omnidirectional, i.e. they work in a specific direction, the truck elements did not cave in. Furthermore, the tipping was a result of the attraction to the ferrous metal rods embedded in the reinforced concrete walls of the evidence room. At max setting, the truck could not keep the magnet immobile and it tipped.<br><br><br><br>The truck used to contain the magnet is a 1977 Ford F-350.<br><br>Gus' laptop is a Samsung RV511.<br><br>The laptop that Walt and Jesse used to test the magnet is a Dell Latitude D630.<br><br>This episode confirms Saul had Huell take the ricin-laced cigarrette from Jesse's pocket.<br><br>This is the shortest episode (42 minutes) of the series.<br><br>Marie Schrader does not appear in this episode.<br><br>This episode was the series' most-watched episode at the time of its airing with 2.93 million viewers, but was later passed by "Say My Name ", which had 2.98 million.<br><br>When Bryan Cranston visited Conan O'Brien on his talk show, Conan called the episode "amazing".<br><br><br><br>Episode References<br><br>Walt's arranging of "52" with bacon mirrors Skyler arranging "50" with veggie bacon in the "Pilot".<br><br>True to other season premieres, the first few seconds of the episode overlap with part of the previous season's finale.<br><br>Walt and Jesse witnessing Tuco's wrath.

Located at 10549 Cibola Loop NW. Filming was done at the back gate and roof. The location where the truck was parked can be seen from outside the gate.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>At a test kitchen in Germany, Madrigal Electromotive executive Peter Schuler glumly tastes a variety of dipping sauces. His secretary interrupts to inform him the police have arrived. On his way to face his fate, Schuler grabs an automatic defibrillator and locks himself in the bathroom. As the authorities pound on the door, Schuler places one of the AED contacts in his mouth and electrocutes himself.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Panicked, Jesse Pinkman tells Walter White over the phone that the ricin cigarette is still missing, fearing an innocent bystander might find it. After promising to help Jesse look for it, Walt fills a similar vial with salt and creates a duplicate cigarette. He then stashes the real ricin — which he retrieved from Saul Goodman previously — behind a wall outlet cover in his bedroom at the White house.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse finds the fake Ricin cigarette   Walt and Jesse toss his house, searching desperately for the cigarette. On the verge of giving up, Jesse heeds Walt's suggestion to check the Roomba — where he finds the fake ricin cigarette. (giving the illusion that Jesse may have dropped it while cleaning his house.) Devastated and broken, Jesse apologizes for accusing Walt of poisoning Brock Cantillo.<br><br>Walt and Jesse visit Mike Ehrmantraut and announce plans to start cooking again, but Mike refuses to partner up. "You are a time bomb," he tells Walt, "tick-tick-ticking... and I have no intention of being around for the boom."<br><br>Hank Schrader, Steven Gomez, and George Merkert meet with several Madrigal executives, recently flown in from overseas. The head of Madrigal is shocked at Schuler's death, and remorseful. He pledges Madrigal's full cooperation with the DEA investigation, wanting to know if Schuler wasn't a "lone anomaly" in the company.<br><br>Hank and Gomez share a drink with Merkert, who has been quietly pushed out of the DEA for his personal relationship with Gustavo Fring and for failing to sniff out Gus' drug empire. Hank says he managed to peek at the laptop before the evidence room debacle, but it was encrypted and he doubts they'd have gotten much off it anyway. "So Hector Salamanca killed Fring, but who gave Salamanca the bomb?" Merkert asks. Gomez mentions APD's discovery of Gus's secret offshore bank accounts as a possible lead. Merket mentions how Gus was close to him, yet somebody else completely (similar to Walt in Hank's situation).<br><br><br><br>         Lydia Rodarte-Quayle  meets with Mike   <br><br>Mike meets Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, one of the Madrigal executives, at a diner. She hands him a list of eleven men who were on Gus's payroll and surreptitiously suggests Mike kill them before they can implicate Mike or herself. Mike shoots down the idea, vouching for the integrity of his men — they are paid to stand up to the heat, and they will.<br><br>At home, Skyler White refuses to get out of bed, insisting Mariano can open the car wash for her. Walt suggests she take a shower to feel better, and she wordlessly obliges; after this eerie absolution, she seems like a shadow of herself.<br><br>Mike walks into the DEA offices as Duane Chow, the proprietor of Gus's chemical warehouse, walks out. "You know they talked to me," Chow says nervously. If Mike is unnerved by that news, he doesn't show a hint of it.<br><br>In an interrogation room, Mike tells Hank and Gomez that he worked for Los Pollos Hermanos as head of corporate security. Hank doesn't buy his story, but admits he doesn't have enough evidence to arrest Mike. Mike is prepared to leave, only for Hank to stop and ask about the money in Mike's granddaughter's name. Mike pauses, as Hank explains that apparently Gus had about a dozen offshore bank accounts in the names of various employees on his staff, including the manager of his laundry, various employees at the Los Pollos distribution center, the owner of a chemical warehouse, and many others, all of whom Hank believes were getting paid off the books. Because it's a bit hard to believe that a fifth-grade girl could be the muscle of Gus's operation, Hank believes the offshore account in Kaylee's name is actually for Mike. Mike denies having any knowledge of the offshore accounts, apparently resistant to their pressure even with the knowledge that the DEA has seized his money.<br><br>Walt and Jesse visit Saul to discuss finding a new venue for the lab, preferably nearby and not in an RV. Saul says an in-town venue will be difficult, but Walt insists that if Gus could do it, they should be able to do it as well. Jesse reports that he was able to find all the precursor chemicals except for methylamine. Walt encourages Jesse to keep looking for it, but Jesse doubts he'll be able to scare any up. When Saul advises they pull out of the meth business, Walt snaps back, explaining that he's broke: "Does that seem like an acceptable stopping point to you?"<br><br>Mike is playing Hungry Hungry Hippos with his granddaughter when Chow calls. He says that the DEA threatened to take his money, and insists that Mike come talk with him at his home, to which Mike agrees. Chow hangs up and looks at Chris Mara — one of Mike's former henchmen — who's holding him at gunpoint: someone is setting a trap for Mike.<br><br>Just before Mike arrives at Chow's house, Chris kills Chow by shooting him in the head. He then watches Mike walk toward the front door and puts his gun muzzle to the peephole. He hears a strange sound and looks through the peephole, where he sees an animatronic toy pig suspended from the door frame, which Mike borrowed from Kaylee's old toys at his apartment. Suddenly, Mike appears behind Chris and orders him to drop his gun.<br><br><br><br>         Mike kills Chris   Chris admits that Lydia was going to pay him $30,000 to kill Mike and $10,000 for each man on the list, starting with Chow. Mike shoots Chris dead with a sigh.<br><br>Later, Mike travels to Houston, sneaks into Lydia's house, and pulls her into a bedroom at gunpoint. Lydia begs him to leave her body in the house so that her daughter won't think she was abandoned. On the verge of shooting her, something stops him. He hesitates and asks if she can still get her hands on methylamine. "Maybe," she says. "Why?"<br><br>Clearly in a corner, and not happy about the decision he's about to make, Mike calls Walt and agrees to a partnership. "Good," Walt says and hangs up. He washes the dishes and then climbs into bed with Skyler, who refuses to face him.<br><br>"What you're feeling right now, about Ted, everything. It'll pass," he says, caressing her arm and kissing her. "When we do what we do for good reasons, then we've got nothing to worry about," he continues. "And there's no better reason than family."<br><br>Skyler, shellshocked and unable to bring herself to stop him, stares silently ahead, but wears a look on her face as if she wants to say something.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br> Marie Schrader does not appear in this episode.<br><br> First appearance of Madrigal Electromotive GmbH (besides only being mentioned).<br><br> This is the first episode to feature a location outside of the United States or Mexico. It is also the first episode to feature characters speaking German. Most of the German-speaking actors have an English accent and are clearly not native speakers of German, except for Peter Schuler, played by Norbert Weisser, and Mr. Herzog, played by Wolf Muser; both are actors of German origin.<br><br> When Walt and Jesse sit down with Mike in his kitchen, a drawing made by Kaylee Ehrmantraut, which says "Blue is Good," is seen over Walt's shoulder.<br><br> After Walt hides the ricin vial inside an electrical outlet and replaces the table in front of it, the novel The Bastard (1974) is prominently visible on the table.<br><br> The film Mike is watching on TV is The Caine Mutiny (1954). <br><br> One of the fast food restaurants seen at the Madrigal offices is called "Burger-Matic", which is a reference to the film written by Vince Gilligan Home Fries (1998), which also featured the burger chain.<br><br> Madrigal has been mentioned before in Seasons 3 and 4.<br><br> Vince Gilligan came up with the concept for an older comedy script he wrote where a character achieves great fame through the invention of Franch. Vince Gilligan eventually concluded that the script would never really go any further from there, so he saw fit to cannabalise the idea for Breaking Bad.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br> Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br> Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br> Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader (credit only)<br><br> RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br> Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br> Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle<br><br> Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez<br><br> Michael Shamus Wiles as ASAC George Merket<br><br><br><br><br><br> Norbert Weisser as Peter Schuler<br><br> Wolf Muser as Mr. Herzog<br><br> Carrington Vilmont as Chief Food Technician<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> James Ning as Chow<br><br> Kaija Roze Bales as Kaylee<br><br> Christopher King as Chris<br><br> Norma Maldonado as Nanny<br><br> Debrianna Mansini as Waitress<br><br><br><br><br><br> Trine Christensen as Secretary<br><br> Mathias Kaesebier as Lawyer<br><br> Brennan Foster as Detective<br><br> Lillian Presley Leyba as Kiira<br><br><br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Frank Sandoval as DEA Agent<br><br>Ryan Schaefer as Madrigal Suit<br><br><br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br>"Stay On The Outside" by Whitey (as Walt & Jesse search for the cigarette)<br><br>"I Can't Hide It" by The Coachmen (in the diner where Lydia meets Mike)<br><br>"Somebody Just Like You" by Mack Owen (in the diner where Lydia meets Mike)<br><br><br><br>Memorable Quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br>Walter: "Mike, I know you don’t care for me.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Posing as a paralegal, Mike Ehrmantraut visits Dennis Markowski, the manager of Gustavo Fring's industrial laundry, in jail. During the meeting, Dennis's lawyer, Dan Wachsberger, tunes out and listens to music: he doesn't want to hear what Mike has to say to Dennis about their ongoing collusion. Mike reassures Dennis that the deal he had with Gus is still in place and he should stay quiet.<br><br>Dennis swears he's loyal to Mike but since the feds took his hazard pay, and everyone else's, "Sooner or later someone's gonna flip." Mike guarantees everyone will get compensated for what the feds took as he's setting up anew, or does he need more than his word on it. Dennis agrees to stick to the deal and they shake on it.<br><br>In the hallway, Mike and Dan go through the list of Mike's guys and where they're being held. It's going to be a long, tiring day, but the two of them are going to see all of them.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Skyler White finds Walter White in high spirits as he unpacks boxes in the bedroom. It's official: he's decided to move back in. When Skyler notices and aprehensively questions whether this is a good idea, he doesn't pay her any mind, insisting it's the way it should be. Skyler's look of worry intensifies, she's not so sure. <br><br>Mike waits outside Saul Goodman's office while Huell Babineaux guards the door. Inside, Walt and Jesse Pinkman assuage Saul's doubts about working with Mike, who once threatened to break Saul's legs. They let Mike in and he lays down ground rules: He runs the business, Walt and Jesse cover production - he'll have it no other way. Saul privately asks Walt if he's okay with the arrangement, but Walt's unfazed: "He handles the business, and I handle him."<br><br>Saul takes the team on a tour of potential new lab venues, but Walt, Jesse, and Mike nix them all, spotting logistical problems with each. Jesse and Mike are ready to dismiss the final venue, Vamonos Pest, but Walt, noticing the folded up tent on the floor, immediately lights up, and declares, "It's perfect."<br><br><br><br>         The new plan to cook meth   <br><br>The next day, the four watch the pest-control team as it tents an infested home. Walt explains his plan: If they cook inside houses undergoing fumigation, no one will bother them or question strange smells. They can hide in plain sight. Saul says the pest crew, run by a man named Ira, runs a burglary operation on the side - they don't steal while on the job, but rather, they copy the house keys and pass along information about the house's security codes and valuables to other criminals, or they wait a while and come back to burglarize the places themselves; they know how to keep secrets. Mike suggests a vote. "Why?" asks Walt. He's already convinced, and so is Jesse.<br><br>Skinny Pete (who is revealed to have a talent with classical piano) and Badger purchase four giant roadie equipment cases from the local guitar store and wheel them into the pest control headquarters — the cases have been stenciled, "Vamonos Pest." They ask Jesse to get in on the new business, but Jesse (noticing one stern look from Mike) doesn't bite.<br><br>Mike debriefs the pest control crew and forbids stealing from the houses. He also orders them never to engage with Walt and Jesse without an invitation. "On the other hand, if they tell you to jump, you don't ask what for," he says. "You jump."<br><br>At Jesse's house, Walt and Jesse finalize plans for the mobile lab. They're interrupted by Andrea Cantillo, who stops by with Brock Cantillo and invites Walt to stay for dinner. Walt sits uncomfortably with Brock on the couch; it's impossible to say if the boy recognizes Walt as the man who poisoned him, but Walt is certainly uncomfortable in Brock's presence. Brock glares at him but says nothing, turning back to his video game. <br><br>After the homeowners leave, Walt and Jesse pull up to an infested house in a Vamonos truck. An employee, Todd Alquist, approaches Walt and informs him that he disabled a nanny-cam in the living room. Walt, impressed with his initiative, asks him what's his name. <br><br><br><br>         Walter and Jesse preparing the lab   <br><br>Walt and Jesse assemble the lab from the roadie cases and cook in a sealed tent inside the house. During a break, they watch TV and drink beer on the living room couch. Walt inquires about Andrea and says Jesse can decide for himself whether to tell her about their work — if he can't confide in her, then there's no way they can keep going. "Seriously?" Jesse asks. "I trust you. I know you'll make the right call," Walt says. "If she loves you, she'll understand." A seed of doubt, consternation and discontent nearly effortlessly planted by Walt the master manipulator.<br><br>At the car wash, Marie Schrader tells Skyler that Hank Schrader is back at work and insists Skyler plan a party for Walt's birthday. When Skyler takes out a cigarette, Marie chastises her as she's not been a smoker in years. She keeps nagging about this and that, setting Skyler on edge, till ... "Shut up!" Skyler screams exasperated. "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" she repeats, and then again louder, breaking down in tears. Marie, at first clearly hurt, is soon concerned and baffled by the outburst.<br><br>In the new "lab," Jesse and Walt weigh the meth and Walt admires the excellent yield. As they leave the house, Jesse sets off the fumigation system to finish the pest control work - the thick fog quickly masks any trace of their's.   <br><br>Walt finds a worry-etched Marie waiting for him at home. Skyler rests in the bedroom as Marie recounts Skyler's breakdown and presses Walt for its origin, concerned for her sister's well being. She's not leaving till he tells her. Walt, cornered, instead tells her that Skyler had an affair with Ted Beneke, who is now in the hospital. Marie is shocked, shooting Walt a look of pity as she attempts to comfort him. Walt begs her to keep it a secret and not mention anything to Hank or Skyler. Marie leaves still dumbfounded. <br><br>At Jesse's house, Andrea and Brock play video games while Jesse zones out. Andrea asks if he's okay. "I'm good," he says, but he's clearly unsettled. The seed Walt planted before is clearly starting to flourish...<br><br><br><br>         Walter, Walter Jr. and Holly watching Scarface   <br><br>After rousing herself from bed, Skyler finds Walt and Walter White Jr. watching Scarface in the living room. She stares silently but disapprovingly, as the two revel in Al Pacino's bloody shooting rampage. Hearing her son discuss the violence so nonchalantly, Skyler is clearly unsettled by this tableau.<br><br>Back at the Vamonos office, Mike divides the profit into three piles — $367,000 each. He takes money from each pile to pay for distribution drivers and Ira's fumigation crew. But Walt balks when Mike takes additional money from each pile to pay his nine jailed men - what Mike calls "legacy costs." Walt's outraged by Milke's audacity, but he tells Walt that since he killed Gus they're his responsibility. Jesse, uncomfortable with them arguing over money, offers to cover Walt's share. To this prideful Walt finally relents, insisting he'll pay his own way, but bitterly complaining at his net reduced profit - "It's less than with Fring," he notes. "Just because you shot Jesse James, don't make you Jesse James," Mike replies, leaving Walt scowling. <br><br><br><br>         The hazard pay erupts an intense discussion between Mike and Walter   <br><br>After Mike leaves, Walt asks Jesse how he feels about it. Jesse glumly reports that he broke up with Andrea as it was inevitable. Walt cuts him short; he was asking about the money. Jesse reasons that ultimately they're getting a bigger piece of the pie than when with Gus, so they shouldn't complain as ultimately they're still doing better and are their own bosses.<br><br>Walt disagrees, and as they're about to leave, he brings up Victor - Maybe, he surmises, Gus didn't just kill Victor to send a message. "Victor trying to cook that batch on his own, taking liberties that weren’t his to take?" Walt says. "Maybe he flew too close to the sun; got his throat cut." Jesse watches Walt walk away, thinking about exactly what that means for their fledgling new enterprise... and was that really a veiled threat..?<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>Walt and Walt Jr. watch a classic scene from the film Scarface (1983). Vince Gilligan has often described the character arc of Walter White as "Taking Mr. Chips and turning him into Scarface."<br><br>Interestingly, Scarface featured in supporting roles a number of actors who were also in Breaking Bad as supporting characters, including Mark Margolis (Hector Salamanca), Steven Bauer (Don Eladio) and Míriam Colón (Tuco's grandmother in Better Call Saul). <br><br><br><br>Hank Schrader does not appear in this episode.<br><br>This is Season 5's least-watched episode, only ranking 2.20 million, while others served as the most-watched episode of the series.<br><br>The title comes from Mike promising Dennis Markowski he'd get his hazard pay, and is also what Walt and Mike fight about in the end of the episode.<br><br>Vince Gilligan has stated he and his writers are proud of the new setup they have made for Walt and Jesse to transact cooking in. Though he has also stated that he doesn't know if setting up mobile meth labs in houses undergoing fumigation would work in real life, but if it were, it'd be a real challenge. <br><br>This episode features the first appearance of Todd Alquist.<br><br>Vamonos Pest uses cyfluthrin for its fogging work, and also has a shelves full of bromadiolone and glyphosate (Roundup).<br><br>The paper strip that Walt drips a liquid onto to get a colour change is probably pH indicator paper. This suggests that Walt is using the pH of a mixture as a proxy for determining when a certain reaction has gone to completion.<br><br>The scene of Walt and Jesse drinking beer on the couch is used in The Simpsons Couch Gag in Season 24 Episode 17 'What Animated Women Want'<br><br>Walt tells Jesse at the end of the episode that maybe Victor 'flew too close to the sun.' Hank used this same line with Walt Jr. when Walt Jr. asked for the Dodge Challenger instead of a cheaper car. <br><br>When Mike tells Walt that paying off the guys in prison is "what you do", Walt dismisses it as Mike wasting money on an unnecessary personal code, and opts to have them all killed instead. But in later episodes, Hank is pretty easily able to flip Huell by convincing him that Walt wants him dead as a "loose end". This actually reflected many real life cases, where crime bosses killed their subordinates too easily and those who still were alive quickly turned to the police in fear that they were going to be next. In other words, Mike's code is the intelligent, reasonable way of dealing with the world of drug-dealing. Mike knew what he was doing, and Walt just didn't have a clue. It's a subtle but key example of how Walt brought about his own downfall by trusting his own judgment above everyone else's, even though he really doesn't get how the criminal world works. This even explains how, in the finale, Walt is able to enlist Badger and Skinny Pete to help him with the Schwartzes: because Walt once made a point of setting Badger free from prison when he got stung by the cops instead of just killing him. Of course Badger stays loyal to Walt, and naturally enough, Skinny Pete, as a friend of Badger's, trusts Walt as well.<br><br>Mike's admonishment to Walt, "Just because you killed Jesse James...don't make you Jesse James," foreshadows Walt's train robbery two episodes later; in the same way (and at the approximate same time in the episode, in the same room) Walt in the next episode says "Nothing stops this train."<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br> Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br> Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader (credit only)<br><br><br><br><br><br> Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br> RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br> Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br> Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Matt Jones as Badger<br><br>Emily Rios as Andrea Cantillo<br><br>Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist<br><br>Mike Batayeh as Dennis Markowski<br><br><br><br><br><br>Franc Ross as Ira<br><br>Charles Baker as Skinny Pete<br><br>Lavell Crawford as Huell Babineaux<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ian Posada as Brock<br><br>Joshua Gomez as Sandor<br><br>Miguel Martinez as Fernando<br><br>Chris Freihofer as Defense Attorney<br><br><br><br><br><br>Kristin Hansen as Deputy<br><br>Alex Knight as Salesman<br><br>Michael Ostroski as Homeowner<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br>"Gambler's Guts (aka You Got The Guts?)" by Doghouse Lords (playing in Dan's headphones while Mike talks with Dennis)<br><br>"Los Galvez's y los Contrera's" by Sergio Caro (in the background at the tortilla factory)<br><br>"Solfeggietto No. 2 in C Minor, H 220, Wq. 117" by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, performed by Charles Baker as Skinny Pete (while he and Badger shop for roadie cases)<br><br>"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever" by The Peddlers (while Jesse and Walt cook)<br><br>"Three Blind Mice (The Three Stooges Main Theme)" by Lyle Murphy (while Jesse and Walt watch TV during the cook)<br><br>"Seaside Hill" by Jun Senoue (video game background music)<br><br><br><br>Memorable Quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br>Saul: "So you bring him here?

                        <div class="ui message"><p>At an auto shop, a mechanic goes over some recent fixes to Walter White's Pontiac Aztek, including cleaning some residue blood off the grill ("Half Measures") from that deer he had hit (which of course was not exactly a "deer"). He jokes that at least the windshield didn't need to be replaced again. Walt looks inside and finds his pork pie hat in the back seat, which he greets with a smile. Just then he has a thought, he offers to trade his Aztek to the mechanic for $100 and immediately lowers it to $50. The mechanic thinks he's joking, as he's just replaced upwards of $1,900 worth of insurance paid parts. Walter White Jr. too asks his dad to slow down but Walt shrugs it off and trades in the car.<br><br>Back at the White Residence, Walt drives home in a brand new shiny pitch black Chrysler 300. Walt Jr., in front of his Chrysler PT Cruiser gives him an uncertain look, politely smiling but clearly not feeling too excited, so Walt trades the PT Cruiser in for his previous new red and black striped Dodge Challenger. They both beam at each other as they grip their respective steering wheels, elated with their new 'toys'.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>At the Houston office of Madrigal Electromotive, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle nervously sits at her desk on a conference call with Germany. She realizes she is wearing mismatched shoes. She receives a tip-off call from Mike Ehrmantraut and seconds later the DEA arrive to question her. She leads them to Ron Forenall who is promptly arrested. Lydia calls Mike to tell him that the methylamine transport will be cut off due to Ron's arrest. Mike informs her he'll send someone else.<br><br>At the White residence, Walt and Jr. brag about who would win in a drag race in their new cars while Skyler White silently eats. In the bedroom, Walt gives Skyler $20,000 to launder. She is stunned, silently stating that Walt is back into the drug game. She then feebly suggests that she wants the kids to leave the house for a period of time. Walt shoots down her idea and tells a silent Skyler that he would like a party and chocolate cake for his fifty-first birthday the following day. During breakfast the next day, Skyler forgets to break Walt's bacon into a "51" and Jr. reminds her. She reluctantly obliges.<br><br>At the DEA office, Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez go over their diagram of Gus' Drug Empire. They're concerned that no one in prison is talking and that Blue Sky has reappeared on the streets. They believe Mike is their best lead and agree to follow him. The standing ASAC (Assistant Special Agent in Charge) talks privately to Hank and offers him the position of ASAC for Albuquerque. Hank accepts the job.<br><br>At a bug bombed house, Jesse Pinkman and Walt break down the mobile lab. Walt asks if he can leave early for his birthday party and Jesse agrees. Walt arrives at home, expecting a party but finds Skyler preparing a store-bought meal.<br><br>In Marie's Bug, Hank pesters Marie Schrader until she reveals that Walt told her Skyler had an affair.<br><br>Hank and Marie arrive at the White house for dinner and chocolate cake. Walt Jr. heads off to drive his new car and Walt gives his sister-in-law and husband a speech about how grateful he is for their support during the rough past year. During the speech Skyler slowly walks deep into the pool and sinks to the bottom. Walt dives in after her.<br><br>At the Houston Madrigal warehouse, Jesse arrives to retrieve a barrel of methylamine from a hesitant Lydia. While lowering the barrel, Lydia finds a GPS device attached to the bottom of it.<br><br>After getting her out, Marie and Hank suggest Skyler needs psychological help and offer to take Jr. and Holly White for a short time while Skyler gets some rest. Walt agrees after finding out that it was Skyler's idea. In their bedroom, he insults Skyler for being shortsighted. Skyler demands that Jr. and Holly stay away from them as long as they are meth dealers and money launderers. Walt challenges her to tell him how she will stop their kids from staying at their home - "keeping his kids from him". She says she'll hurt herself again, to which Walt counters he'll just be forced to have her committed. Or she'll say Walt beat her or she'll send Jr. away to boarding school. Walt is outraged that she's prepared to let Walter Jr. think he's a wife beater. In desperation, she tells Walt that she isn't as good at coming up with these plans as he is, that she's at a loss, just a coward and that all she can do is bide her time and wait. "Wait for what? - What are you waiting for?" asks Walt rather bewildered, wary of the answer. "For the cancer to come back," she blurts back at Walt, looming over her as she cowers on the bed. Walt is beyond shocked to hear that his own wife wants him dead.<br><br>The next morning, Walt receives a call. Jesse tells Mike about the GPS device and Mike, thinking it too sloppily done to be the DEA, believes it was Lydia attempting to get out of their business. Mike prepares to leave to kill her, regretting having given her a chance already, but Jesse stops him and insists they vote on it. Walt tells them that the cooks must not stop under any circumstances, and that they're only just beginning. Mike's not happy stating that Lydia is a liability who will get them caught.   <br><br>In the parking lot, Jesse compliments Walt on his good idea, presumably, of how to deal with Lydia. Jesse gives Walt a brand new TAG Heuer Monaco Chronograph watch and wishes him a happy birthday. At home, Skyler smokes again, using Walt's birthday mug as an ashtray. Walt tells her the children are staying away another day. He then tells her about the watch and how Jesse wanted to kill him a few weeks prior, but came around. He tells her she'll come around too.<br><br>Walt falls asleep to the watch's ticking, which escalates to almost the sound of a gun chamber revolving.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7740017740012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7740017740012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia  <br><br>The episode title appears to be a reference to the age of Walter White, 51. It could also refer to the fact that the balance of Heisenberg/Walter White is teetering.<br><br>The number "51" can be seen on the mug Skyler is using as an ashtray late in the episode.<br><br><br><br>The watch that Jesse gives Walt is the Tag Heuer Monaco, a watch forever linked to and made famous by Steve McQueen in the movie Le Mans (1971). Steve McQueen died of a rare, inoperable lung cancer.<br><br>The ending scene of the episode with Walt's watch ticking is almost a metaphorical meaning that his time is running out.<br><br>Walter puts the watch on Whitman's Leaves of Grass book.<br><br><br><br>Saul Goodman does not appear in this episode.<br><br>This is the fiftieth episode altogether, and Walt turns fifty-one.<br><br>Jr. gets the same type of car (Challenger) as he did in "Cornered". <br><br>Walt says that Marie and Hank are watching  Ratatouille. Somewhat humorously, the film is based on the irony of a rat becoming a chef. This, along with the character Gusteau's famous motto in the film "Anyone can cook!" could be seen as poking fun at Walt's uncharacteristic decision to cook meth in "Pilot".<br><br>Also there's the Gusteau, Gus element to the reference.<br><br><br><br> During this episode, Walter says: "The methylamine keeps flowing, no matter what... Nothing stops this train," which foreshadows the next episode's train heist. <br><br> As Walter returns home and finds Sklyer smoking on the couch, the smoke from the tip of her cigarette drifts upwards form the bottom left to the top right of the frame, while the smoke she exhales blows from the bottom right to the top left, creating a giant X over Walters place in the shot.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br> Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br> Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br> Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br> RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br> Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (credit only)<br><br> Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br> Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle<br><br> Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br> Todd Terry as S.A.C.

It makes you a human being."<br><br>Skyler: "I don’t need to hear any of your bullshit rationales. I’m in it now, I’m compromised, but I will not have my children living in a house where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people is shrugged off as ‘shit happens!’"<br><br>―Walter and Skyler arguing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Walter: "Oh. Now here's the conversation: "So honey, I know you've only got one year left in high school, but I would love it so much if you would drop everything, leave all your friends behind, and go to boarding school in Arizona." Do you have any other ideas? Because I'm not hearing a solution to your problem. How are you going to save our kids from this "terrible" environment?"<br><br>Skyler: "I..."<br><br>Walter: "What are you going to do? What, are you going to run off to France? Are you going to close the curtains, change the locks? This is a joke. Come on, Skyler! You want to take me on? You want to take away my children? What’s the plan?"<br><br>Skyler: "I don’t know! This is the best I could come up with, okay? I—I will count every minute that the kids are away from here—away from you—as a victory. But you're right. It's a bad plan. I don't have any of your magic, Walt. I don't know what to do. I'm a coward. I—I can't go to the police, I can't stop laundering your money, I can't keep you out of this house, I can’t even keep you out of my bed. All I can do is wait. That's it, that's the only good option. Hold on. Bide my time. And wait."<br><br>Walter: "Wait for what?  What are you waiting for?"<br><br>Skyler: "For the cancer to come back."<br><br>―Walter and Skyler arguing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Mike: "You don't know this woman like I do. I had a chance to deal with this before, and I gave her a pass. That's what I get for being sexist. Now if you'll excuse me..."<br><br>Jesse: "Mike, you can't, just—Look, that's our precursor. We need her."<br><br>Mike: "Kid, if we have to ramp down for a while, so be it. It beats working with a lunatic who's gonna get us arrested or killed."<br><br>Jesse: "Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you know? She just seemed, like, uptight."<br><br>Mike: "And now you're being sexist. Trust me, this woman deserves to die as much as any man I've ever met."<br><br>―Jesse and Mike discussing Mike's plan to kill Lydia.<br><br><br><br>vteBreaking Bad : EpisodesSeason 1#1 Pilot • #2  Cat's in the Bag... • #3 ...and the Bag's in the River • #4 Cancer Man • #5 Gray Matter • #6 Crazy Handful of Nothin' • #7 A No-Rough-Stuff-Type DealSeason 2#1 Seven Thirty-Seven • #2 Grilled • #3 Bit by a Dead Bee • #4 Down • #5 Breakage • #6 Peekaboo • #7 Negro y Azul • #8 Better Call Saul • #9 4 Days Out • #10 Over • #11 Mandala • #12 Phoenix • #13 ABQSeason 3#1 No Más • #2 Caballo Sin Nombre • #3 I.F.T. • #4 Green Light • #5 Más • #6 Sunset • #7 One Minute • #8 I See You • #9 Kafkaesque • #10 Fly • #11 Abiquiú • #12 Half Measures • #13 Full MeasureSeason 4#1 Box Cutter • #2 Thirty-Eight Snub • #3 Open House • #4 Bullet Points • #5 Shotgun • #6 Cornered • #7 Problem Dog • #8 Hermanos • #9 Bug • #10 Salud • #11 Crawl Space • #12 End Times • #13 Face OffSeason 5#1 Live Free or Die • #2 Madrigal • #3 Hazard Pay • #4 Fifty-One • #5 Dead Freight • #6 Buyout • #7 Say My Name • #8 Gliding Over All • #9 Blood Money • #10 Buried • #11 Confessions • #12 Rabid Dog • #13 To'hajiilee • #14 Ozymandias • #15 Granite State • #16 FelinaMeanings of the title names of every episode<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Retrieved from "https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Fifty-One?oldid=90591"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Categories:<br><br><br><br><br><br>Breaking Bad episodes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsourced quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Season 5 episodes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Languages: <br><br><br><br>Deutsch<br><br><br><br>Español<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>window.adslots2.push(["TOP_RIGHT_BOXAD"]);<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fan Feed<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>More Breaking Bad Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1<br><br>Patrick Kuby<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>2<br><br>Walter White<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>3<br><br>Jesse Pinkman<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explore Wikis<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jack Ryan Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Inheritance Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Attack on Titan Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explore<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Games<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Movies<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>TV<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wikis<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Follow Us<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Overview<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>About<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Careers<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Press<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Contact<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Terms of Use<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Privacy Policy<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Global Sitemap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Local Sitemap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Community<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Community Central<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Support<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fan Contributor Program<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>WAM Score<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Help<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Can't find a community you love?

                        <div class="ui message"><p>A young boy, Drew Sharp, rides through the desert on a dirtbike. He stops to play with a tarantula, which he then enthusiastically places into a jar. When he gets back on his bike, he hears a freight train in the distance and drives off to follow it...<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Walter White visits Hank Schrader in his new ASAC office where Hank remarks on Walt's expensive new watch. Walt lies and tells Hank it's a birthday present he bought for himself. During their brief conversation, Walt breaks down in crocodile tears, telling his brother-in-law that Skyler White no longer loves him and thinks he is a bad father. Uncomfortable with displays of emotion, Hank quickly excuses himself to get them a cup of coffee and to give Walt some space (as Walt, master-manipulator, anticipated Hank would react). Walt seizes the opportunity to plant a transmitter in Hank's computer and a receiver within a family picture frame on his desk.<br><br><br><br>         Mike giving Lydia instructions.   <br><br>In the basement of an abandoned building in Houston, Walt and Jesse Pinkman stand by as Mike Ehrmantraut threatens Lydia Rodarte-Quayle. He forces her to call the DEA to sort out the GPS's origins, supplying her with a prepared script, threatening her life if she cries or arouses Hank's suspicions in any way. Listening into Hank's phone communications, the GPS trackers were revealed not to be the work of the Albuquerque DEA Field Office. Discussion among Mike, Walt, and Jesse leads to Jesse dissenting but Walt agreeing with Mike that Lydia be killed, with Lydia insisting that it wasn't her doing and begging for her life to be spared. Just as Mike approaches her, the bug picks up a call from the Houston field office confirming to Hank that they placed GPS tracking devices on the outside of all the methylamine barrels. Mike still wants to kill Lydia, but she saves her life by informing the men of an "ocean" of methylamine in a freight train tanker car that passes through New Mexico each Wednesday. Lydia demands a percentage after providing key transport details to boost the methylamine, including the exact position of that tanker car in the freight's lineup, but Mike is skeptical of their ability to complete the heist without killing the engineer and conductor, which he thinks is the only viable way to get away 'clean'.<br><br>At the Schrader house, Hank plays with Holly White as Marie looks on. Hank lovingly tells Holly he's "not going to give her back," and Hank asks Marie how "Emo McGee" is doing. Just as Marie remarks that Walt Jr. is being reclusive and unsocial and Hank replies that his parents treat him like a baby, Walter White Jr., steps out of his temporary bedroom to walk into the kitchen. Marie calls out to him using his current preferred name "Flynn," indicating his defiance once more, again over the temporary relocation and stonewalling by his parents. Hank asks him if he wants to watch the Blu-ray of Heat with him later, and Flynn declines. Marie asks Flynn if he wants some lasagna, and he declines that offer too, angrily telling them he's going back into his room so they can "keep talking about him." Walt, Jr. defiantly returns home sometime later that day. Back at the Whites' house, Skyler stands outside his bedroom door as he refuses to come out. Walt, however, wanting to win Skyler over, uses his parental trump card to order him back to the Schrader house. However, Skyler shows absolutely no gratitude towards Walt for this. Skyler then expresses her fear of Walt and his profession, tells him she will never change her mind about him, and negotiates a deal with him: if Walt agrees to keep the children away from the house while he's engaging in the drug business, she'll launder the proceeds and do as he pleases. She then refers to herself as Walt's "hostage."<br><br>Back at Jesse's House, Mike and Walt argue about how to proceed with production. Jesse once again hangs back on the living room couch, away from the other two as they engage in yet another tense standoff. Mike proposes using pseudoephedrine for the time being, but Walt dissents, suggesting they halt production until they aquire methylamine. The discussion then becomes heated, with Walt accusing Mike of being content to merely scrape together the hazard pay for his and Gus's former associates, and Mike in turn suggesting that Walt actually is willing to go through with the heist, but is waffling about it due to the necessity of killing the two engineers. Jesse, playing with a glass of drink and a straw as the others argue is suddenly inspired and interjects with an idea: what if they can steal it without getting caught (thus negating the need to kill the train engineer and conductor)? He proposes they do a siphon & switch with the liquid chemical, so no one's the wiser it's even gone. This becomes the preferred course of action. <br><br><br><br>         Jesse during the train heist.   <br><br>At some train tracks in the middle of the desert, Mike, Jesse, and Walt measure off 800 feet, the length to reach the methylamine tanker car in the freight train lineup finding that the length aligns perfectly with a small bridge in the tracks. The operation can be completed and well-hidden from the train's crew. Fernando & Sandor, trusted crew members from Vamonos Pest, help dig a hole and bury two giant plastic tanks near the tracks. Todd Alquist, another Vamonos crew member fills one with water, its weight approximately 9/10ths of the weight of the methylamine they intend to heist, and the other remains empty. They plan to replace the methylamine with water as the tanker drains, giving the appearance that the Chinese supplier watered down the product, and deterring any indications of theft. Later, Patrick Kuby blocks the train tracks with a dump truck filled with sand, and the train screeches to a halt. Mike signals to Walt when the conductor and engineer get out to help Kuby with the truck. Jesse scrambles under the train and begins siphoning methylamine into the empty underground plastic tank. At the same time, Todd climbs atop the train, opening the upper lid with a cordless impact wrench and inserting his line of firehose for the replacement fluid. When the meter by Walt displays over 300 gallons of methylamine has been siphoned off into the first underground tank, Walt turns on the compressor to evacuate the water from the second underground tank, signaling to Todd that the replacement water is coming.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse, Todd and Walt moments before Todd shoots an innocent kid.   <br><br>The plan appears to be working until a Good Samaritan drives up, stops and offers to push Kuby's truck off the tracks. Mike warns Walt to wrap things up, but he waits until the last moment possible to finish the operation, forcing Todd to jump off the moving train and Jesse to lay down flat on the tracks, beneath the train. Walt, Jesse, and Todd celebrate their flawless heist, until they see Drew Sharp, who has just caught his tarantula and driven over to the train and just witnessed their brief celebration. The kid nervously waves at the three, who stand in stunned silence staring back.

The yellow stripes also appear on the back of his helmet too.                               <br><br>A scene of Walter calculating the gain from the heist (nearly 300 million USD) , compared to all historical train robberies is deleted but released on Blu-ray and the Italian version.<br><br> Bob Odenkirk, as Saul Goodman, does not appear in this episode.<br><br>Jesse James is once again mentioned in this episode, this time by Jesse Pinkman when he says that boosting the methylamine from a train is just like "Jesse James." Jesse James was previously brought up when Mike Ehrmantraut compared Walter White's murder of Gustavo Fring to Robert Ford, Jesse James' assassin, saying "Just because you shot Jesse James, don't make you Jesse James." ("Hazard Pay")<br><br>The movie Hank says he has on blu ray, Michael Mann's Heat (1995) is a heist film. During the opening heist in which Neil McCauley's crew stages an armored car robbery, one of the thieves, Waingro, executes a guard unnecessarily, and is subsequently dumped by the gang. This parallels the ending of this episode when after the train heist, Todd Alquist shoots the boy, much to the dismay of Mike and Jesse.<br><br>The location for the filming of the train heist outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, is the same location for the filming in 1969 of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in which Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid jumped out of a passenger train.<br><br>The scene where Mike, Jesse, and Walt are interrogating Lydia is very similiar to the scene in the Season 3 episode, Half Measures when Gus has the meeting with Jesse and the two drug dealers that Walt ends up running over. In that scene, Gus tells Jesse that Walt is his only friend in the room, and when Jesse turns to look at Walt Gus tells him: "Look at me, not him." In the scene with Lydia, Mike tells her that Jesse and Walt are being kind to spare her, and when she turns to look at them Mike tells her: "Look at me, not them." <br><br>The shot of Jesse underneath the train was achieved by visual effects, with two separate shots combined: the train moving and revealing the tracks, and Jesse on the tracks.<br><br>Many crew members working on the episode have said it was very tough to film.<br><br>The episode was originally to be called "Dark Territory", but the name was taken from a movie called Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, which also starred Jonathan Banks in pretty much the same exact role he had in this episode. <br><br>During the scene where Walt bugs Hank's office, on Hank's desk sits a black "Function First Collection" gooseneck table lamp. This may be a subtle reference to The Sopranos, in the episode "Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood", where the F.B.I. plants a bug in the exact same type of lamp owned by Tony Soprano.<br><br>The truck used to haul the empty tanks, the dirt, Drew Sharp and his motorbike and block the tracks is an International 9000-Series.<br><br>The earth-mover used to dig the hole for the tanks is a John Deere 310 G.<br><br>In the previous episode "Fifty-One", Walter said: "The methylamine keeps flowing, no matter what. We are not ramping down. We're just getting started. Nothing stops this train." This could be a reference to their train robbery in this episode.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br> Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br> Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br> Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br> RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br> Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (credit only)<br><br> Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle<br><br> Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist<br><br> Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez<br><br><br><br><br><br> Bill Burr as Patrick Kuby<br><br> Jamie McShane as Wallace<br><br> Myk Watford as Engineer<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br> Joshua Gomez as Sandor<br><br> Miguel Martinez as Fernando<br><br> Mary Sue Evans as Janice<br><br> Samuel Webb as Boy<br><br> Ryan Begay as Good Samaritan<br><br><br><br><br><br>Filming Locations<br><br> The train heist was filmed at a location just off US-285 & Spur Ranch Rd. This location is probably one of the furthest from Albuquerque other than the 4 Corners scene. The train bridge is located at 35.498818, -105.916618 and the train crossing where they stall the truck is a few hundred feet away.<br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br>"Dead Freight" by Dave Porter (as the gang rob the train)<br><br><br><br>Memorable Quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br>Jesse: "I hate to say it, but she's right, Mike.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>At the Vamonos Pest headquarters, Mike Ehrmantraut, Walter White, and Todd Alquist unload equipment from their train heist. They then, all still in shocked silence, unload and dismantle Drew Sharp's motorbike and dispose it into plastic barrels. They also prepare a barrel to dispose of Drew's body. Outside, after the grim deed, Jesse Pinkman lights up a cigarette and smokes in deep thought, anger etched in his face. When Todd joins him and tries to make conversation with Jesse by remarking that "shit happens," Jesse turns to him without a word and punches him hard in the eye.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Todd argues his case to Walt, Mike, and Jesse about murdering Drew, claiming that, although it was harsh, it was their only option. He only did as they insisted upon. Jesse is fuming, hardly able to contain himself. The three men send him out of the room to discuss his future in their operation. Jesse, appalled by his actions, does not feel safe with him around and wants him gone. Walt proposes three options: Firstly to fire Todd, bearing in mind that he knows too much and would probably need to be paid for his silence. Second would be to "dispose of him", not an appealing proposition they all agree in silence. The third to demote him back to tenting houses and setting up the lab, keeping him close and in the business as a precaution. While Jesse prefers to fire Todd, Mike and Walt vote to keep him in the business. Mike delivers the news to Todd, but also berates him for his reckless actions, and makes a thinly-veiled threat to kill him if he ever does anything like that again.<br><br><br><br>         Mike at the park   <br><br>At a park with his granddaughter, Mike is watched by Steven Gomez and Agent Van Oster. Later, as Mike's about to leave, he quickly scribbles and hides a note under a nearby garbage can, then calls to his granddaughter and leaves. The DEA agents debate whether to follow him or wait for someone to pick up the dead drop. Gomez approaches the note to investigate and finds that it reads "Fuck You." Back at his house, Mike listens to a recording of Hank Schrader's office and stares blankly when the DEA agents talk about tailing Mike until he makes an incriminating mistake.<br><br>At Marie Schrader's house, Skyler White holds Holly White and breaks into tears, telling her sister that she misses her children but needs them to stay safe. Marie questions her and Skyler vaguely tells her that she and Walt are bad parents. That there's stuff that if she told Marie, Marie would never speak to her again. Marie begs her sister to just try her anyway, as she doubts this. When Skyler is still reluctant, Marie reveals that Walt told her of Skyler's affair with Ted Beneke. Skyler snaps back to reality, withholding her anger, but now even more furious at her husband.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse finds out about Drew's disappearance on TV   <br><br>At a house being bug-bombed by Vamonos, Walt and Jesse watch TV and wait for their current batch of meth to cook. Their program is interrupted by a news report on Drew Sharp's disappearance, which hits Jesse with a wave of grief. Walt, seeing how distraught Jesse is, offers to finish up while Jesse goes on home. Jesse agrees, and while leaving the house, hears Walt nonchalantly whistling "The Lily Of The Valley," (coincidentally, the name of the plant he used to poison Brock.) Jesse is unsettled at hearing Walt's whistling and his seemingly unaffected attitude. Jesse receives a phone call from Mike as he walks out.<br><br>Walt delivers the batch to the Vamonos headquarters, where Mike and Jesse are waiting for him. Mike informs him of the DEA's interest in him. Walt gets upset that he wasn't informed. Mike assures him he was dealing with it, then tells him that he is stepping out of their meth operation. Walt is taken aback but has no choice but to accept. Then, Jesse too informs Walt that he is stepping out and that they are selling their shares of the methylamine to Mike's contact in Phoenix for $5 million a piece. Jesse begs Walt to join them, insisting it's no longer safe and that $5 mil is a lot of money, more than he's ever seen, he adds. Walt refuses to join them, explaining that cooking the methylamine would net up to $300 million.<br><br><br><br>         The buyout   <br><br>The next day, Mike and Jesse meet with Declan to discuss the sale of the methylamine. He refuses to buy 2/3 of the lot, as the steep price also pays to remove Blue Sky from the market and increase his market share. Jesse visits Walt's house and urges him to join the sale. Walt informs him that he was burnt earlier in life by emotionally selling his 50% stake in Gray Matter Technologies for $5,000 and that the company is now valued at $2.16 billion. Then, answering Jesse's question from before, he tells Jesse that he isn't in the "meth" or the "money" business; he is in the "empire business!" Jesse questions if a "meth empire" is really something to be proud of.  <br><br>Skyler gets home and is startled to find Jesse, who is equally startled and excuses himself. Walt stresses that  he should stay, they should all enjoy a dinner together. At the dinner table, the three are obviously extremely uncomfortable to be together in such a setting. Jesse attempts to compliment Skyler on her cooking, but she is short and snappy and jeers at Walt for telling Marie about her affair; she enquires if he's told Jesse too? She fills her glass with wine then leaves the table with the bottle. Walt confesses to Jesse that his marriage and family have crumbled and abandoned him and his empire is the only thing he has left in life. Then chastises Jesse for wanting to take from him the only thing he has left. That he's taking that much away from Walt by selling out. (It was Walt's objective with the dinner to illustrate this.)<br><br>After dinner, Walt rushes to Vamonos to take/move the methylamine, but Mike's already there waiting for him and holds him hostage. Mike plans on holding him until he can sell all 1,000 gallons of methylamine for $15 million without Walt's permission, thinking it the best option for everyone. Mike watches him till morning break, but then zipties Walt to a radiator so he can run an errand. Walt tries to escape by breaking a coffee pot but fails. He then chews through the percolator's  power cord and uses the wires to burn through the tie; badly burning his wrist in the process. <br><br>At Mike's "errand", he and Saul Goodman inform the DEA that they have filed a restraining order against the department for stalking Mike. In Saul's car, he and Mike listen to Hank and Gomez plan their surveillance retaliation. Saul informs Mike that he has at most about 24 hours of freedom, which Mike says is enough for what he needs. Upon returning to the garage, he finds the methylamine gone. He pulls out his gun and finds Walt sitting smugly in the office with Jesse standing nearby. He holds his gun to a calm Walt's head as Jesse urges him to first listen to Walt's plan where "everybody wins." Mike doesn't look convinced but pauses to listen...<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>Walter White Jr. does not appear in this episode.<br><br>This is the second time Jesse and Skyler have talked to each other, the first being in "Cat's in the Bag...".<br><br>Scientific error: Walt, Todd, and Mike use a solution of hydrofluoric acid to dissolve Drew Sharp, which wouldn't affect the plastic components of the bike.<br><br>Scientific error: Walt's escape plan of bringing live electrical wires together would produce an electrical arc, but this would most likely result in a fuse blowing or a breaker tripping (especially with a power bar involved).

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In the middle of the desert, Walter White addresses Declan and his bodyguards about the methylamine deal Mike and Jesse Pinkman had previously arranged. Declan is not pleased to hear there's no methyl amine and that Walt is keeping it all for himself. Walt offers to continue cooking his 99.1% pure Blue Sky. Walt explains that the substantial difference in quality between his and Declan's product (±70%) means they attain a higher yield, which means they have more control over price and by extension a higher a profit margin. He offers Declan's organisation the chance to buy out Mike's 1/3 share and be Walt's distribution channel, guaranteeing that they would make more money with that cut than they would on their own. To further prove his point, Walt demands that Declan "say his name", to which Declan feigns ignorance. But after a little more convincing and at Walt's insistence, he resignedly agrees and acknowledges Walt as Heisenberg. Walt replies "You're God-damned right!" <br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>Back at the Vamonos Pest headquarters, Mike takes his $5 million from Declan and says his farewells to Walt and Jesse, whom he warns to watch out for himself. As they share a last farewell handshake, Walt glares at them as he spies from behind a dirty window. After, Walt and Jesse retrieve the methylamine from the car wash to a load of worried questions from Skyler White who begs to be informed what's going on. Walt tells her to just ignore their actions because he has everything under control and will be out of her hair in no time if she'll only allow them to get on with it.<br><br><br><br>         Dan Wachsberger delivering money to Gus' former employees   <br><br>At a bank, Dan Wachsberger, Mike's partner is depositing hush money to Gustavo Fring's former crew: $15,000 into nine safety deposit boxes and a much larger sum into one final box that's now filled to the brim and has a card reading : "To Kaylee on her 18th birthday". In the parking lot, Mike thanks him and asks if he'll continue with the remaining funds for the nine families, to which Dan reassures him that he will.<br><br>At an undisclosed location in the desert, Mike, after hearing via the bug that Hank is all chuffed to have arranged a search warrant for his place, he gets a move on and dumps his surveillance gear and arsenal of guns into an old well. He then hides a duffle bag in the trunk of a second car and parks it in a long-term parking lot at the airport, hiding the keys nearby. At home, he makes a cup of coffee and waits for the DEA to arrive with said search warrant, personally served by a gloating Hank Schrader. He watches a film as they search his apartment but find nothing, much to a frowning Hank's chagrin. <br><br><br><br>         Walt tries to convince Jesse that there will be no more violence   <br><br>At the Vamonos headquarters, Jesse arrives to talk to Walt about getting his $5 million so he can depart the meth trade. Walt ignores him and pretends as if Jesse will just pick back up and join him in cooking, even all jovially handing him his blue lab gloves. When Jesse continues to refuse, Walt once again insists that there'll be no more violence in their operation now they're in control and that Jesse's life will be empty without cooking meth, even liable to start using again. Attempting to convince him with promises of ten times the amount of money. Jesse implies that Walt is seemingly unaffected by the youngster's murder, to which Walt denies and takes offence. But Jesse's eyes are finally open to the hissing, spitting manipulator in front of him, so he finally gives up and leaves, saying he doesn't even care about his share of the money if Walt's unwilling to give it to him, "I'm just done!" As Jesse walks out, Walt, frustrated and incensed at his slipping control of Jesse, yells after him that if he leaves now he will not receive a single penny.<br><br>At a DEA supervisor meeting, SAC Ramey tells Hank to drop the tail of Mike Ehrmantraut and that the Fring Drug Empire case is effectively closed. He's chastised for neglecting all his many other cases and told to shape up to the obligations of his new position. Steven Gomez arrives and the two talk about the lawyer of the nine henchman, Dan Wachsberger and decide to switch their resources to following him instead.<br><br>In a bug-bombed house, Walt and Todd Alquist, Walt's eager new protégé, prepare to cook a batch of Blue Sky. Walt asks him to try his best and listen as close as possible. Todd attentively takes notes while they cook and seems to give his 100%. At the end of the cook, Walt looks slightly let down, clearly missing Jesse, but realizes that Todd is putting in his full effort. When Walt wants to talk money, more so in an effort to boast and impress, Todd refuses a salary until he better knows what he's doing.<br><br>Back at the bank, Dan begins to drop more cash for the families, but neglecting to lock the door behind him,  is soon surprised by Gomez and the DEA in the vault. At the White Residence, Walt attempts to have a microwave dinner with Skyler who walks out of the room the minute he sits down and starts talking. The next day at Hank's office, Walt visits with another bout of crocodile tears, pretending that he's distraught about Skyler and sobbing she no longer loves him. Hank again fidgets, not knowing what to say or do with himself, so is relieved when Walt requests a cup of coffee. Walt quickly retrieves bug and ethernet tracking device, as per Mike's last command, before Hank returns to drink their coffees in awkward silence. Gomez calls Hank out the office, excited to report that Wachsberger has flipped and is willing to rat out Mike - an eavesdropping Walt almost chokes on his coffee, as he attempts to mask his rising trepidation.  <br><br>At the park with Kaylee Ehrmantraut, Mike receives a call from Wachsberger enquiring his whereabouts. Mike tells him which park and hangs up, but is clearly uneasy. Seconds later Walt calls and tells Mike that Wachsberger has flipped and the police are coming for him now. Mike shoots up and looks about, just as a police car pulls up across the park. Mike moves behind the nearest tree, deciding either to tell Kaylee goodbye and be arrested or to escape the police and leave Kaylee for good. As a second police car appears, he reluctantly decides to escape.<br><br><br><br>         Saul, Jesse and Walt talking to Mike via cellphone   <br><br>At his office, Saul chastises Walt and Jesse for using Wachsberger in the first place. Mike calls and asks for Saul to retrieve his stashed duffle bag from the parked car, although Saul refuses, speculating he's being watched since the DEA know he is Mike's lawyer. Jesse immediately offers to help but Mike refuses as he doesn't want him caught. Finally, Walt agrees to do it. When he gets to Mike's stash, he looks into the bag in the trunk - it contains some bundles of cash, a passport, and a handgun.<br><br><br><br>Near a river, Mike waits for Walt to arrive. Walt finally does but demands that Mike tell him the name of his nine henchmen before he gives up his bag. Mike refuses, then calmly walks up and wrenches the bag out of Walt's hand. Another intense moment erupts between the two, as Mike is angered by Walt's insistence that he's owed at least some gratitude, on Mike leaving with a simple 'goodbye' but no 'thank-you'. Walt blames their predicament on Mike for using an outside lawyer instead of Saul to do the dirty work and allowing himself to be followed by the DEA. Mike, now truly frustrated, blames Walter for everything that's happening since he decided to oppose Gus Fring: "We had a good thing you stupid son of a bitch. We had everything we needed and it all ran like clockwork. You just had to blow it up. You and your pride and your ego. You just had to be the man. If you'd done your job, known your place, we'd all be fine right now!" Mike growls in Walt's face, then gets in his car to drive off. Walt is left clenching his fists in surging ire, unwilling to accept the truth in Mike's words. <br><br>When Mike checks the bag, he discovers that the gun is missing from it's holster, just as Walt, seething out of frustration and anger, walks up to the window and uses Mike's own gun to shoot him - a single shot, the bullet shattering through the glass and into his stomach. Mike steps on the gas only to soon veer off and crash into a nearby rock. Walt is left agape, realizing what he has just done, then runs over only to find the car empty. He frantically looks about, but soon finds and follows Mike's footprints. He finds Mike sitting down on a rock, calmly watching the flow of the river, a gun in one hand, gripping his wound with the other. Walt takes the gun from him and comments that he just realized he could have gotten the names from Lydia, and he apologizes to Mike about how this could've all been avoided. Mike interrupts him with his final request: "Shut the fuck up... and let me die in peace." The two watch the sun about to set and the river in silence until Mike quietly slumps over, finally succumbing to his wound.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>The initial title for this episode was "Everybody Wins," referring to the last line spoken at the end of the previous episode.<br><br>The title of this episode refers to Walter's demand for Declan to call him Heisenberg during their confrontation by urging him to "say my name".<br><br>Mike Ehrmantraut is the second main character to die.<br><br>The movie Mike is watching is Fritz Lang's The Big Heat (1953).<br><br> Marie and Walt, Jr. do not appear in this episode.<br><br> This is the first episode of Season 5 to exclude both at once in the same episode.<br><br><br><br> This is the third time Skyler and Jesse have met, the first being in Episode 2 and the second being in the previous episode. <br><br> This episode was the series' most-watched episode at the time of its airing with 2.98 million viewers, but was later passed by "Blood Money", which had 5.91 million. <br><br> The crew members wore black clothing or black materials tied around their arms as a sad goodbye symbol to Jonathan Banks.<br><br> The code for the bank's safety deposit box room is 265.<br><br>The number of the deposit box reserved for Kaylee, 603, is the area code for the state of New Hampshire. <br><br> Antoine Lavoisier (26 August 1743 – 8 May 1794) was a famous French chemist mentioned during Walt and Todd's first cooking session.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Walt, in deep thought, is observing a fly at Vamonos Pest when when Todd informs him that he has disposed of Mike's car. The two walk to Walt's car and open the trunk, where Mike's body is being kept. Walt lies to Todd and claims that Mike's death had to be done and the two prepare to dissolve his corpse in acid. The garage door suddenly opens, prompting Todd to close the trunk. Jesse enters, asking if Walt met with Mike, and if Mike got the money and got away. Walt evades the question, saying only that "Mike is gone." Jesse questions what should be done about Mike's men, suggesting a vote. Walt tells Jesse that now that he has quit, he no longer has a vote and that Walt will handle it himself. He quickly ushers Jesse out of the garage with a stern glare. The door descends between them.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>In the city jail, Hank rejects a proposed plea deal from Dennis and his lawyer, and leaves to look for a better deal from another former associate of Gus. Meanwhile, at a coffee shop, Lydia defensively refuses to give Walt the names of Mike's men, and the now-incarcerated lawyer who paid their families. She reminds Walt that there's now a tenth name (Mike's lawyer) but states she has not written the names down, and will only divulge them after her safety is assured. She surmises Mike has been eliminated, which Walt confirms. Eager to be of further use to him, Lydia proposes a new business plan to sell Blue Sky in the Czech Republic -- where purity of meth is 60% compared to Walt's 99% -- using her trusted associates on various levels at Madrigal. After negotiating a 30% commission of their joint business, Lydia gives Walt the names. After she leaves Walt lifts his hat off the table disclosing hidden beneath that he had brought the ricin capsule to the meeting (implying that he had intended to kill Lydia to tie up another loose end) but decided not to use it after accepting Lydia's new offer.<br><br><br><br>         Walter at home during the assassination of Gus' former employees   <br><br>Walt meets with Todd's uncle Jack and his associates. They debate the logistics of killing ten inmates in two minutes at three different prisons. The next day, Walt paces around his dining room watching the seconds pass on his new watch. In the prisons, Mike's lawyer Wachsberger and the nine "legacy" members of Gus' Drug Empire are shanked, strangled, or burned alive. Hank is pulled from a photo-shoot with a group of schoolgirls by Gomez and given the news. Three days later, Hank and Walt share a drink at Hank's house and Hank reminisces about his first job as a tree tagger. He wonders if that job was better than his current job Hank describes as "chasing monsters."<br><br><br><br>         Skyler reveals Walter's accomplishment to him   <br><br>Walt and Todd resume cooking meth and deliver shipments to Declan's driver and to Lydia who ships it to the Czech Republic. They perform several cooks in various houses undergoing pest control treatments over a period of three months, while Skyler White continues to launder the drug proceeds and Saul Goodman watches the wires. During a visit to her children at the Schrader residence, Skyler watches as Holly White takes her first assisted steps and Marie makes a comment to Skyler that she and Hank feel they might be "enabling" her family. She suggests to Skyler that it might be time for her and Walt to reunite with the children at their own home, to continue to heal as a family. Later that night, Skyler takes Walt to a storage unit she has rented, shows him a gigantic pile of cash that she has created out of his drug proceeds, having been unable to launder or count it all, and pleads to have her children back home and her life back as she shows him all that he has accomplished.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse receives an unexpected visit   <br><br>Walt goes to the hospital for his routine MRI. After his scan he visits the bathroom where he washes his hands and notices, with a smile, the paper towel dispenser he punched in "4 Days Out." Then he drops by Jesse's home after not being able to reach him by phone. In a tense interchange in which Jesse is distrustful of Walt's intentions, they manage to reminisce about their old RV which Jesse had coined "The Crystal Ship." After a short bout down memory lane, where both almost relax into their old selves, Walt turns to leave. At the door he turns back and tells Jesse, "I left something for you." Jesse hesitantly edges toward two large duffel bags on his porch and to his relief finds that they are full of cash, his owed $5 million's worth. He hauls his haul inside, sits down on the floor and stares at it, his eyes filling with tears of relief, joy and gratitude as he takes his pistol out of his pants, switches the safety back on, then shoves it away from him along the floor.<br><br><br><br>         A family gathering with the Whites and Schraders.   <br><br>Walt returns home and announces to Skyler, "ok, I'm out." Skyler realizes she can have her children back in their home. By the weekend, the White family and the Schraders happily gather around the table beside the pool. Holly is being pushed on her red plastic toy by her brother Walter Jr. as Hank and Walt talk about Hank's Schraderbräu beer. Skyler, seemingly more relaxed, idly chats with Marie about hair styles. <br><br><br><br>         Hank discovers Walter's secret   <br><br>Hank excuses himself to use the bathroom. Sitting down on the toilet in the White's master bathroom, Hank looks around for something to read. After thumbing through a magazine, Hank loses interest and finds a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. As Hank thumbs to the front of the book, he comes to an inscription in a familiar handwriting: "To my other favorite W.W. It's an honour working with you. Fondly, G.B." In an immediate flashback, Hank recalls his discussion of a case with Walt that concerned lab notes by Gale Boetticher ("Bullet Points"), where Hank joked Walt could be 'W.W.' and Walt offered up the 'Walt Whitman' decipher -- and Hank finally comes to the uneasy realization that Walter White is the elusive meth kingpin and mastermind "Heisenberg" that he has been searching for all along.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>The prison killings are inspired by the climactic scene of "The Godfather", in which the film's protagonist is made godfather to a child, whilst a string of brutal murders is carried out on his orders.<br><br>The name of the episode is also the name of one of Walt Whitman's poems: "GLIDING O'ER ALL, through all, Through Nature, Time, and Space, As a ship on the waters advancing, The voyage of the soul--not life alone, Death, many deaths I'll sing."<br><br> The entire cast appears in this episode. Jonathan Banks (Mike Ehrmantraut) appears briefly as a corpse in Walt's trunk and Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) appears in his office, without any speaking lines.<br><br> This is the second episode to feature a large time jump. The second season finale "ABQ" features a several week jump as Walt heals from his surgery, this one approx. three months.<br><br> Continuity error: Todd Alquist's uncle refers to the 10 prison murders as being more difficult than the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. However, bin Laden was killed on May 2, 2011, and the episode presumably takes place in 2010. Vince Gilligan admitted this was a mistake. However, it's possible to explain this away by arguing that Jack is one of the many conspiracy theorists that believes Bin Laden was taken out before then. <br><br> When Walt opens the trunk with Mike's corpse, his car doesn't have license plate. <br><br> The lyrics of "Crystal Blue Persuasion" are used here as an obvious reference to the blue-tinged methamphetamine produced during that montage scene, but songwriter Tommy James has stated that the "crystal blue" refers to the crystal lake in the Book of Revelation and "persuasion" to James becoming a Christian. It was written in 1969.<br><br> Gale Boetticher gave Walter White that copy of Whitman's Leaves of Grass in the episode "Sunset" (White was shown reading that book when he received a call from Hank). The book was also shown in the episode "Hazard Pay" when Walt was unpacking his belongings (he grins when he sees the book).<br><br> The inscribed copy of Whitman's Leaves of Grass used in the show sold at auction for $65,500 on October 8th 2013.<br><br> Walt owns David Reynolds’s 150th anniversary edition of the 1855 Leaves of Grass which, strangely enough, does not include Gale's favorite Whitman poem, "When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer".<br><br> This episode features several 'easter egg' reference to previous episodes in the series, including:<br><br> Walt seeing the fly on the table.<br><br> The painting Walt claimed to have seen before. (Last seen in Season 2, episode 3.)<br><br> The damaged paper towel dispenser in the restroom of Walt's cancer clinic in Season 2<br><br> Lydia mentions the line, "We're gonna make a lot of money together." The same exact line Tuco said in Season 1. Walt seems to remember this and reacts with a hesitant expression.<br><br> Walt tells Lydia, "Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer," which is exactly the same advice Mike gave him in the bar ("Thirty-Eight Snub").<br><br> Walt asks Jesse, "Who's we?"  which is the question Jane asked Jesse after pretending not to know him when her dad visits ("Over").<br><br> Jack describes the plan to kill the inmates with the expression, "Boom, boom, boom," which is how Jesse and Walt described the plan to kill Tuco ("Seven Thirty-Seven").<br><br> Skyler asks Walt to, "Take a drive with me," to go see the cash, just as Gus asked Walt to go see the superlab ("Más").<br><br> Towards the end of the episode, when Walt and co. are sitting on his patio, before it shows them talking and Jr. strolling Holly, it features the same exact filming pattern as seen in several episodes of Season 2 due to the flash-forward with the Pink Teddy Bear.<br><br> Flynn gets called by Louis when he's around Skyler and Marie, which is a reference to the call he got in "...and the Bag's in the River".<br><br> Flynn does a peek-a-boo to Holly, referencing to Jesse doing the peek-a-boo to the kid in "Peekaboo".<br><br><br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br> Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br> Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br> Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br> RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br> Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br> Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle<br><br> Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist<br><br> Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez<br><br><br><br><br><br> Michael Bowen as Jack Welker<br><br> Kevin Rankin as Kenny<br><br> Mike Batayeh as Dennis Markowski<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Chris Freihofer as Dan Wachsberger<br><br> Morse Bicknell as Declan's Driver<br><br> Russ Dillen as Ron<br><br> Antoinette Antonio as TV Reporter<br><br><br><br><br><br> Patrick Sane as Gang Guy<br><br> Scott Ward as Public Defender<br><br> Craig Nigh as Asst.

Walt, this is it. This is what you’ve been working for. I rented this place, and I started bringing it here, because I didn’t know what else to do. I gave up counting it. I mean I had to. It was just so much, so fast. I–I tried weighing it. I figured one bill of any denomination weighs a gram. There are 454 grams to a pound, but there’s a variety of denominations, so..."<br><br>Walter: "How much is this?"<br><br>Skyler: "I have no earthly idea. I truly don’t. I just stack it up, keep it dry, spray it for silverfish. There is more money here than we could spend in ten lifetimes. I certainly can’t launder it, not with a hundred car washes. Walt, I want my kids back. I want my life back. Please tell me–How much is enough? How big does this pile have to be?"<br><br>―Sklyer and Walt facing a mountain of banknotes at the storage facility.<br><br><br><br>Videos<br><br>Inside Gliding Over AllInside "Gliding Over All"Making

                                        This episode aired on August 11, 2013 .
                                        Directed by Bryan Cranston .

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Following the purchase of the M60 ("Live Free or Die"), Walter White drives up to the White residence, which is now fenced-in and derelict. He grabs a tire iron from the trunk of his car and enters the house. Trash and graffiti are everywhere; a group of teenagers skateboard in the empty backyard pool. Something catches Walt's eye as he walks through the wrecked skeletal remains of his living room. It's a single word, spray-painted in giant yellow letters on the wall: "HEISENBERG." In the bedroom, he retrieves the vial of ricin from its hiding spot behind a wall outlet plate. After retrieving the ricin, Walt leaves the house. Back outside, his neighbor Carol catches sight of Walt. "Hello, Carol," he says cordially and she drops her groceries in shock.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Hank suffers another panic attack.   <br><br>Hank Schrader leaves the bathroom, shocked, after reading the inscription in Walt's copy of Leaves of Grass ("Gliding Over All"). He places the book inside Marie's bag on the counter, then he and Marie leave the party, as he complains to her that he isn't feeling well. On the drive home, Hank has a panic attack and drives onto the lawn of a nearby house. He falls out of the car and Marie yells for the homeowner to call an ambulance. Back from the ER, Hank assures Marie there is no need for him to see a doctor, and he makes her promise not to tell Skyler. He then retrieves the evidence portfolio of Gale Boetticher's murder and lays the evidence out on a table in his garage. Hank compares the note "To my other favorite W.W." in the first page of Leaves to the "Favorite W.W." intro in Gale's lab notes; his suspicions of Walt's involvement are confirmed when he can visually see that both are written in the same (Gale's) handwriting.<br><br><br><br>         Lydia scolds Walt for the low quality of Blue Sky.   <br><br>At the car wash Walter reminds Skyler that their "story" needs to come first. Along those lines, he suggests that they buy an additional car wash, which will speed up the money laundering process. Lydia arrives for a wash. She goes and complains that the quality of the meth being produced since Walt left the operation is only 68 percent, which is placing her in a precarious position. She wants him to return for at least a few days and improve the operation. Walter sternly insists that her problems are none of his concern any longer. Skyler walks in and notices that Lydia is there washing a rental car, so asks Walt who she is. After a thought he admits that Lydia is a "former business associate" interested in seeing him return, but reassures her he will not. Skyler follows Lydia outside and tells her to leave and never return. The following morning, Hank tells Marie he's not going into work. On her way out, Marie sees two men delivering boxes. Hank tells them to put them in the garage. They leave and Hank starts searching through files related to Blue Sky, Gustavo Fring, and Heisenberg.<br><br><br><br>         Saul attempts to convince Jesse to keep his money.   <br><br>Skinny Pete and Badger get high at Jesse Pinkman's house and discuss Star Trek at length. Badger explains his idea for a Star Trek episode that features Spock, Kirk, and Chekov in a blueberry pie eating contest. In the imaginary episode, Kirk "yorks" and gives up the game early in the contest. At this point in Badger's story, Jesse grows tired of their conversation and goes upstairs. Badger continues with the story and says that Spock, who is competitive and accustomed to winning games, gets rattled when it appears that Chekov is winning. In fact, Chekov is cheating by using a transporter gun, handled by Scotty, that beams the pie from his stomach into space before he gets too full. However, Scotty gets distracted when Uhura walks into the room with her "big pointies" and accidentally kills Chekov by beaming his guts into space, leaving Spock as the only remaining player and, presumably, winner of the game.<br><br>When he goes back downstairs, Jesse brings his giant bags of money to Saul Goodman's office. While sitting in the waiting room, he grows tired of waiting and lights up a joint. Upon seeing this, the receptionist moves him to the front of the line to see Saul. Jesse says each bag contains $2.5 million and he wants one to go to Mike Ehrmantraut's granddaughter Kaylee and the other to Drew Sharp's parents. Saul seems uncomfortable with the idea but Jesse is adamant. Jesse leaves and Saul calls Walter. Walter takes the call while taking a course of chemotherapy and tells him to hang on to the money, adding that "[he]'ll handle it.". Although hinted at before, it is now confirmed that his cancer has returned. ("Gliding Over All")<br><br><br><br>         Walt begs Jesse to believe he did not kill Mike.   <br><br>Walter shows up at Jesse's door with the money and asks for an explanation. Jesse responds, "It's like you said, it's blood money." ("Say My Name") Walter tells Jesse to stop focusing on the past. He tells Jesse that he's out of the drug business himself and says there's nothing for them to do but live good lives. A teary-eyed Jesse thinks Mike's granddaughter needs someone to look after her. Jesse thinks Mike is dead and that Walt knows more than he lets on about Mike's fate. Walter denies having anything to do with Mike's death and tries to assuage Jesse's suspicions, saying, "I need you to believe me."<br><br><br><br>         Jesse gives away his "blood money."   <br><br>Later, the Whites are eating dinner at home when Walt excuses himself from dinner and rushes to the bathroom to vomit. He inadvertently peers above the toilet and notices his copy of Leaves of Grass has gone missing. He continues to search for the book all about the house. He gets into bed and, suspicious of Hank's possible involvement in the disappearance of the book, asks Skyler what is wrong with Hank. She tells him Hank hasn't been to work all week. Even more suspicious, he sneaks outside in the middle of the night and checks the bottom of his car, finding as he'd feared, a tracking device. Meanwhile, a homeless man knocks on the window of Jesse's parked car at the Dog House, waking him up from a nap. The vagrant asks a rather worse for wear Jesse if he can spare some change and he gives him a large stack of cash. The man, though markedly reluctant and perturbed by this windfall, eventually accepts and Jesse drives off. We next see Jesse, all glassy eyed and deeply perturbed, driving through an impoverished neighbourhood frantically tossing wads of cash into random lawns, visibly desperate to be rid of it all. <br><br><br><br>         Walt menacingly advises Hank to "tread lightly."   <br><br>The two cops who dropped off the files ask Hank if Steven Gomez should be worried. Hank assures them that he's fine. As they leave, Walter pulls into the driveway. Hank nervously clears some evidence files and photos from the table. Walter feigns normalcy and asks how Hank's feeling. He tells Hank to let him know if there's anything he can do and walks away. Half way out Walter pauses, turns back around and shows Hank the tracking device. He says it looks just like the one they used on Gus and asks if Hank knows anything about it ("Hermanos"). Hank drops his pretence and stares at Walt dead seriously as he presses the controller to shut the garage door behind him. As Walt feigns ignorance he's surprised with a punch to the face that sends him sprawling to the floor. As he stands back up Hank pins him against the garage door and growls "It was you!", then expresses his disappointment with all that Walt's done to cover up his identity, mostly disgusted that he'd even killed for it. Without admitting anything Walt attempts to reason with Hank. When that fails, he reveals to Hank that his cancer has returned, and because he's dying, he wouldn't live long enough to see the inside of a jail cell even if Hank prosecuted him, so why even waste the time. Hank tells Walt to bring Skyler and the kids to his house so that he and Walt can talk after. Walter's face hardens, and he tells Hank that will never happen. Hank shakes his head and with a look of total disbelief responds that he doesn't even know who Walt is any more. Walter replies that if, indeed, Hank doesn't know who Walter is, then he should probably "tread lightly"...<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br> When Carol drops her groceries in the opening, oranges are seen rolling down the sidewalk. It could be yet another reference to The Godfather, where oranges are known as a sign of incoming violence.<br><br>Oranges previously made a prominent appearance after Ted Beneke crashed into a cabinet, and a number of oranges fell on him. ("Crawl Space")<br><br><br><br>In the Breaking Bad Insider Podcast for the episode, Vince Gilligan revealed that an original idea for the opening scene was to have the White residence completely gone and demolished and only the empty pool in the backyard.<br><br>When Walter and Hank confront each other in Hank's garage, Hank is wearing a dark red shirt (a sign of aggression or death) and Walt is wearing white or light beige (symbolizing innocence or peace). <br><br>The license plate of Walter's car reads 5BB920X, which may refer to Season 5 of Breaking Bad Episode 9, part 2.<br><br>This episode was the series' most-watched episode at the time of its airing with 5.91 million viewers, but was later passed by "Ozymandias", which had 6.37 million.<br><br> Walt confronting Hank with the GPS tracker mirrors him confronting Skyler with an empty cigarette packet in Season 2's "Breakage".<br><br> Hank drinks out of a plum Fiesta mug.<br><br> In the flash forward, Walt breaks into his former house, using a tire iron, which is what Hank used in his attempt to break into the RV in "Sunset".<br><br> The first thing Marie audibly says to Walter when Hank walks onto the porch is "you are the devil" - referencing Hank's realization just moments ago.<br><br> This is the last episode where Walter Jr. interacts with his uncle Hank. <br><br>Anna Gunn's birthday is on the same date as the original broadcast, August 11.<br><br>Jesse Plemons (Todd Alquist) does not appear in this episode.<br><br>The episode is dedicated to Kevin Cordasco, a 16 year-old Breaking Bad fan who succumbed to neuroblastoma in March 2013.[1]<br><br><br><br>Evidence observed by Hank<br><br><br><br>A picture of Gustavo Fring making a donation, large novelty check in hand, smiling with a recipient.<br><br>A portrait of Gus.<br><br>Gale Boetticher's napkin notes.<br><br>A picture of Gale's corpse.<br><br>A photo mosaic of items at Combo's murder.<br><br>A photo of Combo's corpse.<br><br>A childhood photo of Combo.<br><br>A black and white picture of Don Eladio Vuente.<br><br>A picture of a chicken farm.<br><br>A receipt from Amazon.com for an International P7050 Mini Bug Detector.<br><br>A photo of the rear of Jesse's first car, "THE CAPN" on the licence plate.<br><br>Photos from the scene of Tuco Salamanca's death, mostly of Hank's 2006 Jeep Commander.<br><br>A photo of Tuco's corpse.<br><br>A mugshot of a younger Hector Salamanca, accompanied by a certificate of baptism.<br><br>Long-distance photos of Mike Ehrmantraut.<br><br>A portrait of Duane Chow, and a photo of his corpse.<br><br>A photo of the gas mask Walt left behind at his first cook.<br><br>A portrait of a young, unshaven Gale.<br><br>A mugshot and sketch, both possilbly of Emilio Koyama and a mugshot of Ron Forenall.<br><br>A portrait of Tyrus Kitt.<br><br>Photos from the scene of Gonzo's death, including one of Hank smiling by his corpse.<br><br>A photo of the charred superlab remains.<br><br>Surveillance footage of Walt and Jesse's first Methylamine heist.<br><br>A "Heisenberg" drawing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Episode References<br><br>The title of the episode refers to Walter White's comment that Jesse Pinkman should not take his share of the money, since it is "blood money." ("Say My Name")<br><br>The episode title may also literally reference Walt's use of barrels throughout the series. Before this episode, he would use barrels to dispose and liquefy the corpses of murdered victims into blood and other chemicals. Shortly after in the next episode, he would use barrels to hide all his drug money, which would then be buried.   <br><br>While in the bathroom, Walt folds a towel and places it under his knees shortly before vomiting. This is reminiscent of Gustavo Fring's preparation before vomiting in Don Eladio Vuente's bathroom. ("Salud")<br><br>Walt switching his voice tone while talking to Lydia at the A1A Car Wash is similar to Gus' handling of Walt while at Los Pollos Hermanos. ("Bug")<br><br>Like "Gliding Over All", this episode features several objects and references to previous events on the show, of which they include:<br><br>Hank's neighbor's kid plays with a radio-controlled car. ("Seven Thirty-Seven")<br><br>When Jesse takes out his cigarette packet, it reminds Huell Babineaux of when he stole the ricin cigarette from him. ("End Times")<br><br>When Hank is looking through evidence, we see his homemade beer company logo. ("Breakage")<br><br><br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br> Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br> Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br> Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br> RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br> Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br> Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle<br><br> Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist (credit only)<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br>Matt Jones as Badger<br><br>Charles Baker as Skinny Pete<br><br>Lavell Crawford as Huell Babineaux<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Tina Parker as Francesca<br><br>Pedro García as Mariano<br><br>Cheryl Ford-Mente as Carol<br><br>Debi Parker as Min-Ye<br><br>Chad Brummett as DEA Agent Artie<br><br><br><br><br><br>Joe Nemmers as DEA Agent Scott<br><br>Wayne Dehart as Homeless Man<br><br>Brett Shane Cooley as Homeowner<br><br>Ray Chavez as Skater<br><br><br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br>Taber Cross as Neighbor<br><br>Jyl Murray as Car Wash Patron<br><br><br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br> "White House Visit" by Dave Porter (as Walt walks around his former home)<br><br> "If I Didn't Love You" by Squeeze (during the barbecue with Hank & Marie)<br><br> "Manhattan (aka NYC Delight)" by The Longo Brothers (feat.

All along, it was you! You son of a bitch. You drove into traffic to keep me from that laundry. That call I got telling me Marie was in the hospital...that wasn't Pinkman. You had my cell number. You killed ten witnesses to save your sorry ass. You bombed a nursing home. Heisenberg. Heisenberg! You lying, two-face sack of shit."<br><br>―Hank confronting Walt.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>"I'm sorry you feel this way. I want to beat this thing, I do. I'm back on chemo and I'm fighting like hell. But the truth is... in six months you won't have someone to prosecute. Even, even if somehow you were able to convince anyone that I was capable of doing these things. You and I both know I would never see the inside of a jail cell. I'm a dying man who runs a car wash.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>An elderly man leaves his house in the still dark early hours of the morning and starts his pickup truck, parked in his driveway. He notices something in front of his car and investigates, discovering that the unknown object is actually a stack of cash. After inspecting the money in his headlight, he inspects further and notices there are more stacks scattered across his neighbors' yards. He follows the trail of money, collecting wads of cash as he goes, and finds an abandoned car, driver's door wide open, and a duffle bag in the passenger seat half filled with bundles of cash. Bewildered, half salivating and growing suspicious, he then hears an odd squeaking sound; which he follows and leads him to find Jesse Pinkman, listlessly spinning on a playground merry-go-round, lying on his back, staring up to the stars.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Skyler talking with Hank.   After leaving Hank's garage, Walter tries to call Skyler but Hank already has her on the line. Walt rushes to the car wash and finds that Skyler has already left. Skyler meets with Hank at Perea's New Mexican Restaurant, where after a brief chat, he slyly asks to record everything she knows about Walt's criminal activities "while it's still fresh in her mind". Uncomfortable by Hank's eagerness she says nothing and reluctantly tells Hank she thinks a lawyer should be present for her protection before she says anything. Hank tells her that their interests are the same — to keep Marie, Skyler, Holly, and Walt Jr. safe. Skyler tries to leave but Hank desperate for her not to leave without first implicating Walt, stops her, grabbing her wrist. Coming to her senses, she begins to repeatedly shout, "Am I under arrest?", attracting attention in the diner. Eventually, accusing Skyler of not thinking straight, Hank regretfully releases his grip and lets her leave.<br><br>Huell Babineaux and Patrick Kuby visit the storage locker to move the stash and Huell, eyes as large as saucers, can't resist lying down on the massive pile of cash, savoring the moment and fighting the temptation. Huell suggests 'Mexico' and Kuby reminds him that Walt had 10 men killed - in jail - in under 2 minutes. So, best they not even think it, he suggests as he too does an "Uncle Scrooge." Meanwhile, Walter who's angry and hurt that Skyler went directly to Hank and believing she's talked, is going over his options with Saul Goodman, who asks if Walt has considered sending Hank to 'Belize'. Walt is outraged Saul would think he'd do that to a family member and rules that out as a possibility. Huell and Kuby soon show up with the many barrels of cash. Walt gives them a duffel bag of cash in return for their services then drives the van out to the Tohajiilee reservation, where he spends the rest of the night, alone, burying the cash at the GPS coordinates +34° 59' 20.00", -106° 36' 52.00" - which he then sets to memory. <br><br><br><br>Marie visits Skyler at the White Residence and questions Skyler about how long she has known about Walt's          Walter buries the money.   criminal activities. Skyler sits and cries, and Marie infers that Skyler had known about Walt's crimes before Hank was shot on duty. When Skyler reluctantly nods that it's true, as she apologises Marie slaps her then attempts to leave with Holly. As the sisters argue and Skyler tries to take back Holly, Hank enters to the commotion of all three screaming; he tells Marie to leave the child with her mother. In the car, Marie tells Hank "you have to get him."<br><br>Walt drives home in the early morning hours. Covered in dirt and exhausted, he's surprised to find Skyler home. Skyler follows him into the bathroom pleading for him to speak to her and telling him that she didn't tell Hank anything. Halfway through undressing Walt collapses to the bathroom floor. Hours later, he wakes up to a worried Skyler wiping his brow. He tells Skyler he will turn himself in if she promises to not give back the money, so as to not make all that he has been through and done meaningless. She tells him that Hank has no evidence and their best course of action is to remain silent.<br><br><br><br>          Meanwhile, in the middle of the Arizona desert Lydia Rodarte-Quayle is driven to Declan's gang's meth lab — a buried bus under a make-shift junkyard. She inspects the facility and demands that they improve the quality of their meth because her buyer in the Czech Republic expects a better product. She suggests they take Todd back, but Declan scoffs at her. Lydia looks at her watch, presses a button on it, and soon Declan and his cook are called to the surface.  Lydia then looks at her phone and preemptively hides in a corner of the bus while gunfire breaks out. A man calls for her to come out. It is Todd, who suggests she keep her eyes closed while he helps her navigate through Declan's gang's scattered corpses. Todd's uncle's, Jack, and the White Supremacist gang (who previously helped Walt commit the ten prison murders in "Gliding Over All") have crushed and raided Declan's own meth operation in order to take over; taking Declan's cooking equipment for themselves. <br><br>Marie takes the next day off from work and urges Hank to take his evidence against Walt to the DEA. Hank tells her that the minute the DEA finds out Walt is "Heisenberg", his career is over but that he wants his last act to be the bringing of evidence to light incriminating his brother-in-law. He finally returns to work at the Albuquerque DEA office where Steven Gomez tells him that Pinkman has been tossing out stacks of money from his car and has been pulled in. Hank visits an interrogation chamber and asks the officers questioning a silent Jesse to give him a couple of minutes with him. He then walks into the interrogation room alone...<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760037760012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>Walter buries his money in the Tohajiilee Navajo reservation in New Mexico, and the site of his first cooking session with Jesse.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Outside a diner in Arizona, Todd Alquist leaves Walter White a voice message about the recent change of management from Declan and requesting Walt return his call. Inside, he brags to his uncle Jack and his partner Kenny about his train heist of methylamine ("Dead Freight"), naming Mr.White, and leaving out his role in shooting Drew Sharp. Afterward, Jack and Kenny visit the bathroom, where Jack notices and nonchalantly wipes considerable blood off his shoe with a paper towel then flushes it down the toilet. The three then leave the diner and haul the methylamine back into New Mexico.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Hank interrogates Jesse.   <br><br>Hank Schrader enters Jesse Pinkman's interrogation room and tells him he knows that his brother-in-law is "Heisenberg". This finally jolts Jesse out of his daze, looks up at Hank, surprised. He suggests Hank beat the truth out of him as his usual modus operandi. Saul Goodman then timely arrives for damage control, scolding Jesse for blatantly throwing out money and landing himself there. Saul calls Walt at home and tells him about the situation. At home Walter White Jr. tells his father that he's going to visit his aunt Marie as she's requested help with a computer problem. Walt, realizing that this is merely a ploy to lure his son, stops him and reveals to Walt Jr. that his cancer has returned. With teary eyes, Walt Jr. tells his father that he would prefer to stay home with his father in that condition. Hank arrives home and Marie chews him out for not telling the DEA about Walt's true identity. At home, Walt sits down in front of a video camera and Skyler White asks him "are you sure about this?" as he begins to film a confession.<br><br><br><br>         Hank and Marie watch Walt's confession video.   <br><br>The Whites and the Schraders apprehensively meet at a Taquería. Without admitting anything, Walter asks Hank to discontinue his investigation as this would devastate his son and destroy his family. Marie coldly tells Walt to kill himself, as Walt's actions would die with him, while Hank suggests that Walt will not get off that easily. When they realise any further talk is futile, Walt leaves them a DVD, and the Whites leave. <br><br>At the Schrader Residence, Hank and Marie watch the DVD. In the DVD, Walt falsely claims that Hank was Heisenberg and lured Walt into being his chemist, that  Gustavo Fring was Hank's partner and threatened Walt's family when Walt tried to withdraw from the conspiracy. He claims that eventually Gus put a hit on Hank, resulting in serious injury to Hank (partially true,). Walt makes one truthful statement: that it was his drug money that covered Hank's medical bills of over $177,000. Continuing with his lies, Walt claims that after the attempted hit, Hank worked with Hector Salamanca to kill Gus, using a bomb Walt was forced to build. The video concludes with Walt saying he is afraid Hank will kill him and harm his family, and that he has contemplated suicide because of Hank's actions and his own guilt at allowing himself to be drawn in to all this during a weak moment due to his cancer diagnosis. Hank and Marie watch agape, hardly believing Walt's audacity and what they've just seen. <br><br>Hank deduces the video is a threat in case he doesn't desist the investigation, but when Marie confesses that she unwittingly used Walt's drug money for the medical bills, Hank laments that this gives credence to Walt's story and torpedoes Hank's own credibility. He chastises Marie, that this will be the final nail in his coffin as far as his career goes. <br><br><br><br>         Jesse confronts Walt about his true intentions.   <br><br>Walt meets with Saul and Jesse in the desert. Saul and Jesse catch Walt up on what they know — that Hank knows some things but hasn't told the DEA. Walt informs Jesse that Saul can contact someone that specializes in creating new identities. He advises Jesse to start over and have a better life "You get a job. Something legitimate. Something you like. Meet a girl. Start a family even." Jesse is skeptical and confronts Walt about his true motivations, telling him to stop "working him". Why doesn't he just admit the truth and say he needs this for himself and rather just ask him for a favour, instead of falsely feigning he's doing this for his (Jesse's) benefit. He then reveals that he believes Walt will kill him in the same way he killed Mike if he refuses this offer. Jesse claims that Walt does not actually care about him, and only wants him to leave for his own goal of derailing Hank's investigation. Walt walks up to Jesse, who wearily flinches at his approach, and holds him in a tight embrace. Jesse does not hug back but nevertheless goes limp and breaks down into tears, sobbing in his arms. At the A1A Car Wash a clearly stressed Skyler sits, staring wearily. A shadowy Walt tells her not to worry as "it worked", then assures her they're going to be fine.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse realizes that Walt poisoned Brock.   <br><br>At the DEA office, Steven Gomez asks Hank why two of his agents are tailing Saul. Hank calls them off, then leaves the office for the day. At his office, Saul calls the extractor for Jesse who then lights up a joint. Saul tells Jesse to hand over his marijuana, telling him that if the extractor sees him with it, he will not take him. Jesse stubs out the joint but refuses to give up his marijuana and places the bag back into his pocket. Jesse then asks if he is allowed to pick wherever he desires, in which Saul suggests he should head to Florida. Jesse ultimately decides to go to Alaska and seems buoyed by the idea. Saul sends him with Huell Babineaux and a bag of cash for his rendezvous with the 'cleaner' to claim his new identity. On the side of the road, as Jesse waits he realizes Huell lifted his bag of weed out of his pocket, and finally pieces together that Walt asked Saul to have Huell lift the ricin cigarette from his person months prior ... and so, is probably responsible for poisoning Brock Cantillo after all. ("End Times")<br><br><br><br>         Jesse furiously pours gasoline all over the White Residence.   <br><br>He misses his pick-up and returns to Saul's office, barges right past Saul's incompetent bodyguard Huell, and punches Saul to the floor; Saul attempts to retrieve his gun from his cabinet but Jesse gets to it first and uses it to threaten a confession out of him. A bloody nosed Saul, faced with a bullet, vehemently admits that Walt did tell Saul to lift his cigarette, but that Walt convinced him it was for Jesse's own benefit and that he had no idea Walt would go on to poison Brock. Jesse, now beyond furious, leaves with Saul's car keys and the gun. Saul immediately grabs a phone and attempts to warn Walt. Walt rushes to the car wash, attempting not to alarm Skyler, he walks to the soda machine in the lobby, claiming to be investigating a broken latch, and retrieves his thirty-eight snub revolver hidden there. He then tells Skyler that he needs to go pick up a prescription and departs. At the White residence, Jesse swerves Saul Goodman's stolen car onto the front lawn. He gets out of the car and grabs a tank of gasoline from the trunk. He then walks up to the front door, kicks his way in, and furiously starts pouring gasoline over all the furniture and elsewhere in the front room...<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7710017710012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>By the end of this episode, everyone in Walt's immediate family (excluding Holly) has now wished death upon him.<br><br>Editor, Kelley Dixon, stated on the Breaking Bad Insider Podcast that this was her favorite episode of Season 5B.<br><br>When Walt and Jesse lean against Saul's car in the desert the first letter on the license plate is covered by Walt. Instead of LWYRUP (Lawyer Up) it reads WYRUP (Wire Up), a possible foreshadowing of Jesse getting a wire by Hank in the next episode.<br><br>While the neo-nazis are at the diner the song "Gonna Romp and Stomp" by Slim Rhodes is played in the background. A Romper Stomper is a slang term for a skinhead.<br><br>As Hank and Marie are watching Walt's video a fly is visible on the screen, a possible allusion to the fly metaphor from the episode "Fly".<br><br>The opening line of Walt's fake confessional where he tells his full name and address is a reference to Walt's confessional from the "Pilot". <br><br>Many fans guessed this would be the episode where Jesse finds out about Brock because of the promotional trailer for the episode where we heard Saul crying and saying he never planned for "it" - Brock getting put in the hospital - to happen. They also thought this due to the title of the episode.<br><br>Jack scratches his boot in the teaser, revealing blood, mirroring Mike in the bar in "Thirty-Eight Snub".<br><br>When Jesse spreads the gas across Walt's house, he stops at the end of the scene in one spot and the camera switches angles so that it is looking up at Jesse as he splurges the gasoline down. This spot in the house is very close to the exact same spot where Jesse held the gun to Walt's head and was going to kill him in the Season 4 episode, "End Times".<br><br> Aaron Paul won the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in this episode.<br><br> This is the last episode where Walt and Marie directly interact with each other. The last thing Marie says to Walt is to just kill himself in order to free the family from the burden of his criminal activities. This episode is also the last time Hank and Skyler interact with each other. The last thing Hank says to Skyler is warning her she will not get off easy if she continues to be loyal to Walt.<br><br> Paying close attention, one can see Huell pickpocketing Jesse's marijuana when he brushes up against him as he leaves Saul's office.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (credit only)<br><br>Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez<br><br> Lavell Crawford as Huell Babineaux<br><br> Michael Bowen as Jack Welker<br><br><br><br><br><br> Kevin Rankin as Kenny<br><br> Gonzalo Menendez as Detective Kalanchoe<br><br> Guy Wilson as Trent<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br> Tina Parker as Francesca<br><br> Jason Douglas as Detective Munn<br><br> Mary Sue Evans as Janice<br><br> Millard Drexler as Customer<br><br> Caroline Patz as Waitress<br><br><br><br>Uncredited<br><br> Jon McGarrah as Garduño's Diner<br><br> Louise Stange-Wahl as Restaurant Patron<br><br> Michael Stoneas Car Wash Customer<br><br><br><br><br><br>Featured Music<br><br> "Midnight Blue" by Rita Remington and the Smokey Valley Symphony (in the diner during the teaser)<br><br> "Everyday" by Mack Self (in the diner during the teaser)<br><br> "Gonna Romp and Stomp" by Slim Rhodes (in the diner during the teaser)<br><br> "La Casa de Olvera B" by Liza Carbe and Jean-Pierre Durand (in the Gardunia's Taqueria restaurant when the Whites meet the Schraders)<br><br> "Chaparrita A" by Liza Carbe and Jean-Pierre Durand (in the Gardunia's Taqueria restaurant when the Whites meet the Schraders)<br><br> "A la Orilla del Mar (Instrumental)" by Francisco Rodriguez/Marc Ferrari/Matt Hirt (in the Gardunia's Taqueria restaurant when the Whites meet the Schraders)<br><br> "Living the Dream" by Chieli Minucci/Emanuel Kallins/Steve Skinner (in the carwash before Walt goes to meet Jesse)<br><br> "Almost Alaska" by Dave Porter (while Jesse waits for the extractor)<br><br> "Nice N' Easy" by Die Solisten der SDR Big Band (The Soloists of the SDR Big Band) (in the carwash as Walt retrieves the gun)<br><br> "Gas Can Rage" by Dave Porter (as Jesse pours gas over Walt's lounge)<br><br><br><br>Memorable Quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br>"It was perfect. No one even knew they got robbed, just like we planned. Mr. White told me it was, like, the biggest train heist ever, like, potential money-wise. So that's how that happened."<br><br>―Todd describing the methylamine heist to his uncle.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you’re watching this tape, I’m probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my fiftieth birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was astounded. I–I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time–something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn’t want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman, named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn’t know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh, I guess… I guess you call it a hit on Hank, and failed, but he was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me. And he gave me no option in that. I have often contemplated suicide, but I’m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months he kept them. My wife, who had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. I can’t take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."<br><br>―Walter's fake confession.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jesse: "Would you just, for once, stop working me?"<br><br>Walter: "What are you talking about?"<br><br>Jesse: "Can you just, uh, stop working me for, like, ten seconds straight? Stop jerking me around?"<br><br>Walter: "Jesse, I am not working you."<br><br>Jesse: "Yes. Yes, you are. All right? Just drop the whole concerned dad thing and tell me the truth. I mean, you’re–you’re acting like me leaving town is–is all about me and turning over a new leaf, but it’s really–it’s really about you. I mean, you need me gone, ‘cause your dickhead brother-in-law is never going to let up. Just say so. Just ask me for a favor. Just tell me you don’t give a s___ about me, and it’s either this–it’s either this–or you’ll kill me the same way you killed Mike. I mean, isn’t that what this is all about? Huh? Us meeting way the hell out here? In case I say no? Come on! Just tell me you need this!"<br><br>―Walt and Jesse at meeting in the desert.<br><br><br><br>vteBreaking Bad : EpisodesSeason 1#1 Pilot • #2  Cat's in the Bag... • #3 ...and the Bag's in the River • #4 Cancer Man • #5 Gray Matter • #6 Crazy Handful of Nothin' • #7 A No-Rough-Stuff-Type DealSeason 2#1 Seven Thirty-Seven • #2 Grilled • #3 Bit by a Dead Bee • #4 Down • #5 Breakage • #6 Peekaboo • #7 Negro y Azul • #8 Better Call Saul • #9 4 Days Out • #10 Over • #11 Mandala • #12 Phoenix • #13 ABQSeason 3#1 No Más • #2 Caballo Sin Nombre • #3 I.F.T. • #4 Green Light • #5 Más • #6 Sunset • #7 One Minute • #8 I See You • #9 Kafkaesque • #10 Fly • #11 Abiquiú • #12 Half Measures • #13 Full MeasureSeason 4#1 Box Cutter • #2 Thirty-Eight Snub • #3 Open House • #4 Bullet Points • #5 Shotgun • #6 Cornered • #7 Problem Dog • #8 Hermanos • #9 Bug • #10 Salud • #11 Crawl Space • #12 End Times • #13 Face OffSeason 5#1 Live Free or Die • #2 Madrigal • #3 Hazard Pay • #4 Fifty-One • #5 Dead Freight • #6 Buyout • #7 Say My Name • #8 Gliding Over All • #9 Blood Money • #10 Buried • #11 Confessions • #12 Rabid Dog • #13 To'hajiilee • #14 Ozymandias • #15 Granite State • #16 FelinaMeanings of the title names of every episode<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Retrieved from "https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Confessions?oldid=85855"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Categories:<br><br><br><br><br><br>Breaking Bad episodes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsourced quotes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Season 5 episodes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Languages: <br><br><br><br>Deutsch<br><br><br><br>Español<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>window.adslots2.push(["TOP_RIGHT_BOXAD"]);<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fan Feed<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>More Breaking Bad Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1<br><br>Patrick Kuby<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>2<br><br>Walter White<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>3<br><br>Jesse Pinkman<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explore Wikis<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Mini 4WD Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Inheritance Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Glitchtale Wiki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explore<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Games<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Movies<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>TV<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wikis<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Follow Us<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Overview<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>About<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Careers<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Press<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Contact<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Terms of Use<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Privacy Policy<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Global Sitemap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Local Sitemap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Community<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Community Central<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Support<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fan Contributor Program<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>WAM Score<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Help<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Can't find a community you love?

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Walter White parks his car down the street from his house just after collecting his revolver from the car wash ("Confessions"). Saul Goodman's car is parked in his driveway and the house door is open.<br><br>Walt jumps the wall to the backyard and enters the house from the back entrance, the living room smells like gasoline and there's a gas can lying on the floor. He notices that the carpet is soaked in gasoline, but there are no signs of Jesse Pinkman's presence. Walter checks every single room in the house to make sure, he then walks outside and investigates the interior of Saul's car. There is used meth on top of a CD. It appears that Jesse's been using, but has mysteriously changed his mind before torching the house.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>A cleaning crew cleans the carpet of the White house and a locksmith replaces the locks. Huell Babineaux takes back Saul's car. Walt is insistent the locks remain exactly the same (surely to cover up what has happened from his family), and that the cleaning crew remove all traces of the gasoline scent. The cleaning crew says the scent cannot be removed because it has soaked too deep, into the carpet padding and floorboards. Walt calls Jesse and nobody answers, so he leaves a voice message telling him that they should talk about what happened. The crews leave and Walt ponders what has transpired for a while before soaking his clothes and the driver's seat of his car in gasoline. Skyler White returns and Walt tells her and Walter Jr. about a malfunctioning gas pump, saying that he unintentionally left his clothes soaked with gasoline lying on the living room floor, causing the bad smell. Jr. urges his father to be truthful about the spill, thinking his cancer has caused him to blackout again, which Walt reluctantly agrees may have played a small part in the "accident at the gas station". Walt suggests the family go to a hotel temporarily to escape the fumes.<br><br><br><br>         Skyler talking with Walt.   Outside the hotel, Walt meets with Saul and Patrick Kuby, urging them to find Jesse. Saul suggests Jesse be taken out to pasture like the rabid dog Old Yeller and Walt scoffs at the suggestion, saying that he doesn't want Saul to ever mention any of these kind of ideas again. Back inside the hotel room, Walt acts like he left just to grab some ice in the lobby, but Skyler was spying on him and saw Walt talking to Saul. She asks Walt to tell the truth about the gasoline and why he just had a secret conversation with Saul, and he tells her that Jesse found out about something that he did and got angry, prompting him to attempt to burn their house. Skyler is shocked, saying that she knew that someday, somebody would come to their residence trying to hurt them ("Cornered"). Walt insists that Jesse changed his mind and Saul is working on finding him, so they can talk and make peace, but Skyler surprisingly suggests that they kill Jesse to make sure that this is not going to happen again - "We've come this far. For us. What's one more !?" - leaving Walt speechless.<br><br>Hours prior to these events, Jesse drives Saul's car and parks it on Walt's driveway. He snorts a line of meth from the CD, grabs the gas can from the trunk, kicks the door down and pours gasoline all over the furniture and carpet of the White family home ("Confessions"). He takes a lighter from his pocket and is about to torch the place when Hank Schrader enters the room and points his gun at Jesse. He orders Jesse to calm down and put out the lighter so they can talk. Jesse yells that Walt cannot just keep getting away with things, mentioning that he poisoned a child just to accomplish his needs. Hank suggests that there is a better way -- he and Jesse can work together to take down Heisenberg once and for all. Hank takes Jesse to his car and they drive off just as Walt parks his car at the end of the street, barely missing Hank's departure (scene from the beginning of the episode) by mere seconds.<br><br>Marie Schrader meets with her therapist, Dave and talks about poisoning a "family friend" who betrayed their trust and endangered many lives. Dave tries to get details but she refuses. Perceiving Dave's alarm she adds for him not to worry as she could never actually harm anyone, only that it's feeling real good to fantasise about it. When she returns to her home, she notices two of her bags ready waiting for her at the entrance, Hank urges her to leave because he is dealing with something that Marie may not like. After asking Hank what's going on, he tells her that he got Jesse to help him take Walt down, and he is sleeping in the other room. Upon learning this is bad news for Walt, Marie insists on staying and helping any way she can. Jesse's cellphone rings inside Hank's pocket, but he doesn't answer. He listens to the voicemail shortly after and discovers a message from Walt, asking Jesse to meet up with him.<br><br><br><br>         Walt and Walter Jr. hug by the pool.   Walt sits by the hotel pool, deep in thought, thinking about how he can get Jesse on his side. His son joins him and shares his concerns about his father's mortality. Walt stresses that he will survive this bout of lung cancer and they hug. Walt Jr. heads back to his hotel room as Walt decides to leave Jesse another voice message. <br><br>The following morning, Jesse wakes up, now slightly more sober, and sees Marie who asks if he wants coffee. He finds Hank and Steven Gomez in the living room setting up a video recorder to get a confession from Jesse. After showing some initial concern to their approach, Jesse spills the whole can of worms, on everything from the rival dealers to the murder of Drew Sharp. Some time later, Hank and Steve step out onto the balcony, standing silently for several minutes, stunned by the sheer measure and amount of Walt's crimes. Gomez tells Hank he believes Jesse, but they need solid proof to convince the rest of the office about Walt, since all they have until now is the word of a junkie against "Mr. Rodgers with a lung tumor". The three sit at the table to decide their next move, Hank reveals the second voice message left by Walt during the night, asking Jesse to meet him the next day at noon in a plaza. Hank asks Jesse to wear a wire and meet Walt, so they can finally get some concrete evidence of his criminal activities. Jesse believes he will be killed, believing that Walt will be one step ahead of everyone because he is a lot smarter ("you two are just guys... Mr. White is the devil!") Hank tries to show Jesse from his own testimony that Walt would not hurt Jesse and actually cares for him-at least to some degree. When Jesse leaves, Hank tells Gomez that he doesn't care if Jesse is killed — he only cares about catching Walt.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse calling Walt from a pay phone.   At the meeting location, Hank tapes a wire to Jesse and sends him on his way. The place is open and public, Walt is sitting on a bench in the middle of the plaza. Jesse is approaching Walt from behind when he sees a hulking man staring at him, scared of this being part of Walt's plan to kill him, Jesse changes his course for a pay phone. He calls Walt and tells him the meet is off because he saw what he was walking into, and now he is going to get Walt back - and this time "where he really lives." Jesse then walks off as a furious Hank picks him up in the next corner, complaining that Jesse blew up their last chance to get Walt, but Jesse tells him he has a better plan. Back at the plaza, Walt gets up from the bench and passes by the hulking man, who in the end was not associated with him at all — he was merely a random father watching his daughter play in the park. A now really concerned Walt gets in his car and calls Todd Alquist to talk to his uncle about "another job".<br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>The title refers to a scene where Saul implies Jesse is like a rabid dog that needs to be put down (references the movie "Old Yeller (1957)"), but Walt shoots down the idea.<br><br>In the episode "Problem Dog", the dog that needed to be put down was Gale Boetticher, shot by Jesse himself. In this episode, Jesse became the dog.<br><br>It also refers to a scene between Skyler and Walter where Walter states that "Jesse is not just some rabid dog" when Skyler implies that they should kill Jesse.<br><br>Skyler asking Walt to kill Jesse, to make sure that problems won't happen again, leaving Walt speechless, resembles the scene in "Breakage" where Walt asks Jesse to handle the Spooge situation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As Walt douses his clothing in gasoline, his gun is shown to be tucked in the back of his underwear. This seems to reference the "Pilot", which also showed Walt having his gun in the back of his underwear.<br><br>It is the seventh episode to reference an animal in the title.<br><br><br><br>When Walt asks Patrick Kuby about his search for Jesse, Kuby tells him, "I put a bug in the tall kid's mom's place.  For three hours straight all he kept talking about was something called Babylon 5."  Bryan Cranston had a small part in that show as Ranger Captain Ericsson in the episode "The Long Night."<br><br>When Saul is in the car talking with Walt, he makes a joke by saying that even though Jesse beat him, "deep down inside he loves me." Mike says this same line in his speech to Walt in the episode "Half Measures".<br><br><br><br>In this episode, Jesse meets Marie for the first time. Walt Jr. is the only series regular who never shared a scene with Jesse.<br><br>When Hank encounters Jesse in Walt's house just before Jesse burns the house down, Jesse is standing in the same spot where Walt was when Jesse had a gun pointed right between Walt's eyes ("End Times"). But this time the gun is pointed at Jesse.<br><br>The scene where Jesse starts recording his confession to Hank and Gomez mirrors Walt's confession in the previous episode.<br><br>At the same scene, there is a book named "The Rat" while Jesse becomes a "rat".<br><br>When Jesse is looking at Hank's bookcase, he picks up a copy of "Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan". Ronald Reagan heavily opposed illicit drug use and declared them a threat to national security. Drug raids and drug-related incarcerations rose dramatically during his administration.<br><br>A DVD box set of "Deadwood" appears on a bookshelf in Hank's house. It does lead one to ask why Hank doesn't think his sister-in-law looks like the actress who played Martha Bullock, a Deadwood character played by Anna Gunn.<br><br><br><br>The scene where Jesse warns Hank and Steve about how dangerous Walt is, saying "Whatever–whatever you think is supposed to happen–I’m telling you, the exact reverse opposite of that is going to happen, okay?" is a foreshadowing of the drastic change of events in the subsequent episode.<br><br>Jesse is worried about the meeting with Walt being an assassination attempt, saying "There will be one of those guys in a clocktower". In the plaza scene, a clock can be heard chiming in the background.<br><br>The microphone and wireless audio system Hank uses during the failed meeting was the actual equipment used by the film crew to record the dialog.<br><br><br><br>The scene where Hank and Jesse plot to meet Walt at the plaza, the table centerpiece resembles the 5000 milliliter flask Walt was excited about in season 1 while stealing glassware from the school.<br><br>When Jesse is getting into Hank's car, the pink teddy bear can be seen stuck in a tree behind him.<br><br>The hotel pool where the White family is staying is reminiscent a batch of Blue Sky during its final stage of production.<br><br>Saul's white jacket and the red shirt with long collar resemble the clothes of Al Pacino in a scene in "Scarface (1983)".

                                        Directed by Michelle MacLaren .

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Jack, Kenny and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle observe the final stage of Todd Alquist's cook in their compound. Jack and Kenny remove their masks, Todd tells them that "Mr. White" told him that it's not good to breathe the smoke, but Jack just orders him to hurry up so he can go grab a smoke. Todd measures the meth at 76% purity, but Lydia still unimpressed questions if the blue color is going to appear anytime soon, complaining that it is not the signature color her European customers expect from Blue Sky. Jack makes fun of Lydia, "it looks blue to me." Kenny assures that if the quality is better than what "that guy who looked like Wolverine" made, then there is nothing to complain about.<br><br>Later, Todd brings Lydia some tea and tells her he can get better with practice. She thanks him for all the effort he is making before realizing that Todd is uncomfortably close to her. She says that she needs to leave because she has a flight to catch. As Lydia walks away, Todd checks the lipstick mark she left on the mug and rubs his finger along it's edge and looks at the lipstick smear on his finger longingly. Just then he receives the phone call from Walter - from the previous episode ("Rabid Dog") - requesting he needs his uncle to do "another job". Todd says that he is going to set the meeting and asks how many people and in which prison, but Walt tells him that the target is "currently" not in prison and is only a single person: Jesse Pinkman. Todd drinks from Lydia's teacup as he watches her drive off.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Gomez listens to Jesse's plan.   <br><br>Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez meet after the failed sting and discuss options. Hank says that Jesse has a plan to get Walter, but Gomez doubts Jesse is able to come up with something useful. They approach him in the car, Jesse tells them that they need solid evidence of Walt's criminal activities, but Walt got rid of any possible evidence linked to him, except for one thing: his money. If they can find the money, there is nowhere for Walt to run. Gomez asks if Jesse knows where the money may be, Jesse answers that he doesn't -- but there is someone who may know. At the Schrader home, Gomez brings a piece of some or other animal brain and some information: Huell Babineaux has been taken into witness protection to be interrogated about the money. Gomez is worried that maybe the guy will call Saul Goodman (whom they now know is one of Walt's accomplices), and claims if he does, regardless of Hank being his boss, he will put a stop to the entire situation himself, but Hank believes that he won't, under the circumstances. Hank throws the brain on the ground and says that it's Jesse's turn.<br><br>At the DEA safe house, Huell sits on the couch as Hank and Gomez come in to question him about the money. Hank fakes that Walt is getting rid of anyone connected to the poisoning of a boy named Brock Cantillo and Huell is on the hit list. He also lies that Patrick Kuby has been missing for some time, but Huell doesn't belive that Saul Goodman would simply allow Walt to take people out like this. Hank then shows a fake picture of Jesse dead on the floor with his brains blown out, which causes Huell to panic and say that he doesn't have any intel about Walt's actions. Hank asks about the money, Huell reveals that he and Kuby did collect the money for Walt, they put it inside seven barrels and took them inside a van to Walt. Later, Walt returned with a dirty van and without the barrels. Walt took a shovel from the van and left as he and Kuby cleaned the van and returned it to the rental agency. Hank and Gomez now have information from Huell on which van it was and where it was rented. The two agents leave, with Hank giving a final warning to Huell not to use his cellphone in any way and not to leave the house for his own safety.<br><br>Walt meets with Jack and Kenny and contracts with them to kill Jesse. Jack correctly surmises that Jesse is a rat, but Walt assures him that this is not the case, he just needs Jesse to go away. Jack questions why would Walt want to kill his former partner. Walt says that Jesse is like a member of his family and all he wants is for Jack to kill him, quick and painless. Walt offers to pay triple of what he paid for the prison job ("Gliding Over All"), but Jack refuses to accept monetary payment for the hit, asking Walt to oversee a few cooks with Todd instead. When Walt says that he won't, because he is out of the business, Jack refuses to do the hit. Walt reluctantly accepts to do only one cook, to help Todd remember how to cook Blue Sky again, and will only do this after Pinkman is killed. Jack and Walt shake hands to formalize the negotiation, and Jack asks where he can find Jesse. Walt says that he doesn't know, but there is a way to lure him out.<br><br><br><br>         Walt visits Andrea.   <br><br>Walt pays a visit to Andrea Cantillo, Brock stares at Walter as he and Andrea talk in the kitchen. Walt says that he and Jesse got into an argument and now he can't find Jesse anywhere, thinks he's been using drugs again and no one has been able to find him. Andrea gives Jesse a call and leaves a voice message asking him to call her back. Walt then leaves and gets in his car, and he calls Kenny and another neo-nazi member from Jack's gang who are sitting inside a car next to Andrea's house, telling them that Jesse may show up anytime soon now, and reminds them to do it quick and take him away from there before Andrea or Brock can see it.<br><br>Hank, now in possession of Jesse's phone, intercepts the call from Andrea. He is aware that Walt is attempting to set a trap for Jesse, and deletes the call. At his house, Gomez tells Hank that the rental company did not have GPS trackers on their vans. Jesse urges them not to give up on finding the money now. Hank says that it is very possible that Walt buried his money somewhere in the desert, and Gomez immediately says that there is no way that they can simply find out where the money is buried. Hank comments that they know that the van didn't have GPS tracker -- but Walt doesn't.<br><br><br><br>         Skyler and Walter Jr. talking to Saul.   <br><br>At the A1A Car Wash, Skyler White teaches Walter Jr. how to ring customers up. Saul arrives and Skyler looks furious while Jr. is slightly star struck. Jr. comments that Saul is "the lawyer from the billboard and commercials" Saul jokes with Jr., Walt comes in carrying Holly White and instantly walks out after realizing that Skyler and Jr. are talking to Saul. Outside, Saul tells Walt that Huell has disappeared and he is frightened for his life. Walt notices that Saul is using a bulletproof vest and tries to calm him down, saying that it's not possible that Jesse is conducting a killing spree. Skyler watches from the car wash as the two are talking. Back inside, Skyler asks if they had any "progress," and Walt tells her that it's currently ongoing. As she goes back to the cashier, Walt watches his wife and son together, afraid for their lives. A few moments later, Walt receives a picture message of a barrel full of cash buried in the dirt followed by a phone call from Jesse. Jesse claims he's going to burn everything, the one in the picture and "the six others."<br><br>Walt rushes to his car and speeds through Albuquerque to the location of his buried money ("Buried"). Walt demands over the phone that Jesse not burn it, but Jesse says that if Walt turns off the connection for any reason, he will burn all of the money. Walt hopelessly yells at Jesse not to do it, he reveals to Jesse that his cancer is back and he won't even live long enough to spend a single dollar of the money, it belongs to his children so they are the only ones he is hurting by burning it. Jesse is angry at Walt for bringing "children" into this conversation(referencing both the poisoning of Brock and the murder of Drew Sharp). Walt says that his poisoning of Brock was not to kill the boy, he worked out the dosage meticulously, he only needed to have Jesse on his side to kill Gustavo Fring. Jesse continues to threaten Walt, who says that all the crimes he commited were to protect Jesse as well as himself - killing both Emilio Koyama and Krazy-8 and ran over two drug dealers just to save Jesse. Walt says that he cares about Jesse like he was his family, but he is the only one who can't see it. Walt panics when Jesse doesn't answer him, screaming into the phone. Walt arrives at the Tohajiilee reservation and notices that there are no tracks of Jesse anywhere around the area where the money is buried -- he was just lured into a trap.<br><br><br><br>         Walt spots a vehicle approaching.   <br><br>After a panicked moment, Walt sees an SUV approaching through the desert. He hides behind a rock and calls Jack, saying that Jesse just trapped him in the desert and he needs backup right away, believing that Jesse brought a hit squad with him to kill Walt. Jack asks for information about what's happening and Walt says that there are probably a couple more people inside Jesse's car and if Jack really needs Todd to learn how to cook Blue Sky properly, he must come and get him out of this immediately. Jack gives a signal for his men to prepare for combat while Walt gives him his GPS coordinates asking the neo-nazis to come as fast as they can. Walt strains to see how many men are with Jesse, only to realize that they are Hank and Gomez. Walt is shocked into silence as Jack tries to ask him what's happening multiple times and Walt tells him to forget it(as he would rather go to prison than have Hank killed). Jack insists on knowing what's the problem and Walt vaguely orders him not to come and hangs up (Walt however does not tell Jack that police are on the scene). As Hank calls out for him, Walt stares in silence and sadness, knowing that he now has been finally defeated by Hank and that Jesse has in fact turned rat on him.<br><br>Walt gets out from his hiding spot, gun in hand, while Hank and Gomez point their weapons at Walt and Hank tells him to drop the revolver and raise his hands. Walt does as Hank says and slowly approaches them. Hank orders Walt to stop, turn around, put his fingers on his head and get down on his knees. Walt follows every single step without hesitation and Hank finally handcuffs the infamous "Heisenberg." Hank gleefully reads him his Miranda rights, as Jesse stares on with a modicum of growing doubt and regret in his eyes for what he's done as he sees Walt being arrested. Walt says merely one word - "Coward!" - as he glowers at Jesse, who approaches the handcuffed Walt and spits in his face. Walt rams him into the nearby parked car; the two men try to fight but are separated by the DEA agents. Hank puts Walt in the SUV as Gomez orders Jesse to get in Walt's car and wait. Gomez congratulates Hank on his victory, and Hank says that they will probably have to call a search team to find the buried money and also warn the Navajo police about their presence there. Before doing this, a puffed up Hank calls Marie Schrader  (who asks him, "why are there what looks like brains in our garbage can?") to excitedly share the good news and says that the following weeks are going to be hard for them, but then it will get better. Marie is overjoyed that Walt has been caught. Hank hangs up, unaware of how tragic things are about to turn.<br><br>Inside the SUV, Walt realizes that there are two vehicles arriving[1] -- the neo-nazis came even though Walt ordered them not to. Walt screams to warn Hank, who ignores him. Gazing at the approaching car and truck, Hank and Gomez momentarily wonder if the newcomers are Navajo police. Jack, Kenny, Todd and three other heavily armed neo-nazis spill out of the vehicles and aim their weapons at Hank and Gomez. The two DEA agents also draw their guns and order the gangsters to drop their weapons. Jack and Kenny respond that they will only drop their weapons if Hank shows his badge, but Hank refuses, telling them once again to drop their weapons. Jesse takes cover inside Walt's car, and from inside the SUV Walt screams at Jack multiple times not to shoot. The agents and the neo-nazis share a moment of tension and silence before Kenny starts to open fire, and both parties begin spraying bullets at each other. Hank and Gomez find temporary safety behind the SUV but are drastically outnumbered and outgunned, as they are only two against six, and only have a pistol and shotgun against automatic weapons. Walt quickly tries to get down as bullets start to rip the SUV apart.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7790017790012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>Tohajiilee is the name of a Navajo reservation in New Mexico. It was the site of Walter and Jesse's first cooking session ("Pilot"), as well as the burial place of Walt's money. ("Buried")<br><br>The handshake Walt shares with Jack, where Walt only reciprocates after a tense period of time, leaving Jack hanging, is near identical to a handshake he shared with Mike in "Madrigal", except the parties are swapped - Walt was the one left hanging back then.<br><br>The mug that Todd gives to Lydia for her tea has a picture of an American flag, and says "These colors do not run", ironic given that it takes place immediatly after a scene in which Todd fails to impart a blue coloration to the meth he cooked.<br><br>Jack suggests they use blue food coloring to color the meth Todd cooked the proper blue color and better pass off the meth as authentic Blue Sky. Declan used the same technique to the same end. Many meth dealers in real life also used this technique as the show grew in popularity.<br><br>When Hank finally arrests Walt, he does exactly what he told Walt that he promised to do to Heisenberg when he thought Gale may be Heisenberg. ("Bullet Points") Hank 'slaps the handcuffs' on Walt and then waves to him the exact same way he does in 'Bullet Points'. The wave mimicks Gene Hackman to Frog One in The French Connection.<br><br>Walt raising his arms to surrender resembles Gus raising his arms to taunt Gaff to shoot him in "Bug". <br><br>This is the first (and only) time Walter Jr. and Saul Goodman have met.<br><br>The warning Jesse gives Hank and Steve about how dangerous Walt is comes to pass, saying "Whatever–whatever you think is supposed to happen–I’m telling you, the exact reverse opposite of that is going to happen, okay?" Indeed, just when it seems Hank finally beat Walt, the tables were completely turned on him.<br><br>In addition, it was always intended for Walt and Jack's White Supremacist Gang to carry out the hit and have Jesse Pinkman dead. Ironically, the exact opposite later happens where Jesse is the sole survivor out of all of them, whilst Walt and Jack's Gang all end up dead instead.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In a flashback from Walter White and Jesse Pinkman's first cook inside the RV in the Tohajiilee reservation ("Pilot"), Walt is explaining to Jesse about the reactions during the cooking process as they wait for the batch to cool. Jesse buffs him off and nearly lights a cigarette before Walt warns him to do it on the outside. They exit the RV and Jesse jokes at Walt removing his lab apron, since he is wearing only his underwear beneath it. Walt takes a few steps away from the cook site while Jesse is smoking and calls his wife, Skyler. He deceives her with the excuse that Bogdan Wolynetz is delaying him at the car wash due to problems with some documents, and unaware of his deception, she accepts this but requests that Walt brings pizza for dinner on his way home. Skyler suggests the name "Holly" for their baby, and Walt tries the name on for size a few times before they say their goodbyes. Walt thinks about his unborn daughter and smiles as he powers down his cell phone. Walt, Jesse and the RV images fade to the deserted setting of Tohajiilee.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Hank's final moments.   <br><br>Nearly 20 months later, at exactly the same place where Walt and Jesse did their first cook, the shootout between Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez of the DEA versus Jack's White Supremacist Gang comes to an abrupt end ("To'hajiilee"). Gomez lies dead in the sand after being shot twice in the chest, and Hank is injured, shot in the leg. With his pistol empty, Hank tries to crawl towards Gomez's shotgun, but Jack approaches and stops him from doing so. Todd Alquist checks Walt's 2012 Chrysler 300 SRT-8 for Jesse, but he is nowhere to be found.  Jack orders two of his men to search the area for him.  Kenny checks Gomez's wallet, only to find his DEA badge. Jack is about to shoot Hank point blank when Walt, still handcuffed inside the SUV, realizes what is going on and screams for Jack not to kill Hank. Walt is brought to Jack, still handcuffed, and he pleads for Hank's life, but Hank refuses to collaborate and threatens Jack by saying that he has backup on the way. Walt reveals that Hank is actually his brother-in-law, and Jack is upset for just finding out that Walt has a relative working for the police.  Walt then offers to give Jack his buried $80 million dollars -- only if they let Hank go. Hank still refuses to cooperate, telling Jack to "go fuck [himself]."  Walt continues to plead Jack for Hank's life, but Hank tells Walt "You're the smartest guy I ever met, and you're too stupid to see he made up his mind ten minutes ago". Hank tells Jack to do what he's going to do, and Jack kills Hank by shooting him in the head. Walt is horrorstruck; he drops to his knees and then falls to the ground on his side, crying.<br><br><br><br>         Jack acquires assurance from Walt.   <br><br>Now knowing about the buried money's existence, Jack and Kenny again check the GPS coordinates given by Walt and they use a shovel found inside Gomez's SUV to start digging. Soon they find one of the barrels full of money, and all the other white supremacist gang members help Kenny dig up the $80 million. The other two gang members return after failing to find Jesse.  Todd watches Walt lying on the sand and feels sorry for him.  Meanwhile, Walt notices something beneath his car. The Neo-Nazis load all seven of the barrels of money into their truck and they then drag Hank and Gomez's corpses into the hole where the money barrels were and bury them in it. Todd approaches Jack and convinces him to leave one of the barrels to Walt as a sign of apology for what they've done. Knowing that Todd respects Walter, Jack orders his men to load one of the barrels into Walt's car.  They then help him up, take the handcuffs off of him and Jack shakes hands with him, saying that there's no need for bad feelings about what happened.<br><br><br><br>         Todd insists to capture Jesse personally.   <br><br>Walt, still slightly in shock, tells them they still owe him a hit on Jesse. Jack assures that once they find him, they will get the job done -- but Walt reveals that Jesse was hiding under his car the whole time. The gang members drag Jesse out and put him on his knees. Jack points his gun at his head and Walt gives Jack the nod to kill Jesse, but Todd stops his uncle from pulling the trigger, suggesting they interrogate Jesse to find out what the DEA knows. Jack says that once they are done with the interrogation, they will get rid of Jesse, and Walt agrees to the plan without hesitation. While Jesse is escorted to the gang's truck, he is yelling and resisting until Walt stops them and reveals to Jesse that he watched Jane Margolis die, and did nothing to help her as she choked to death on her own vomit while high on heroin ("Phoenix"). A horror-stricken Jesse becomes quiet as he is hauled away. Walt sullenly approaches his car as the white supremacist gang leaves, taking Hank and Gomez's SUV with them. Walt takes a final look at the place where Hank is now buried and then he drives off. In the background, the rock where he stood at the episode's open is seen.<br><br><br><br>         Skyler and Marie discuss Walt's apprehension.   <br><br>Driving back to Albuquerque, Walt's car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert -- a bullet from the shootout has pierced his gas tank. He decides to roll the barrel full of money through the desert until he arrives at a Navajo man's house and buys the man's truck with $10,000 cash. At the A1A Car Wash, Skyler leaves Walt a message, worried about the way he left the place hours ago. A happy Marie Schrader, unaware of the drastic change in events, arrives and tells Skyler they need to talk in her office. When the two sisters are in private, Marie reveals that Hank has arrested Walt "dead to rights." She explains that Hank, along with Gomez, has been working with Jesse to secure enough evidence to put Walt behind bars. She also tells her sister that she still believes there is good in her and to redeem herself she must give up all copies of the slanderous video Walt filmed. Skyler agrees. Then she asks Skyler to come 100% clean to Walter Jr. Skyler refuses, but Marie warns her 'You tell him or I will'.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse is kidnapped by the neo-nazis.   <br><br>Jesse wakes up in the bottom of a concrete cellar at the White Supremacist Compound, his face beaten to a pulp. Todd drops a ladder down and Jesse pleads that he has told them everything already — that Hank and Gomez were working alone and his video confession is still at the Schrader Residence. Todd kindly takes him up the ladder into a warehouse and tethers him to a hanging wire on a rail in the white supremacist's meth lab. Todd walks off, Jesse notices a strange photo on a steel bar on the other side of the lab, he walks to see it while dragging his tether with him: It's a picture of Andrea Cantillo and her son, Brock Cantillo. Todd reappears in his yellow hazmat suit and says casually to Jesse, "Let's cook."<br><br>Walt Jr., incredulous and disheartened, curses at his mother and aunt, calling them liars. They both stress that what Skyler is telling him is true -- that his father is a dangerous drug dealer. Jr. decides to try calling his father, his aunt tells him that there is no way he can reach him nor his uncle Hank at the moment, but he will be able to get more details about it soon. Jr. walks off furious as Skyler starts to cry in sorrow, Marie tells her to get her kids home in the meantime, since it's better for them to regroup as a family at the moment.<br><br><br><br>         Walt tells his family that they need to leave town.   <br><br>Walt screeches into his driveway in his newly acquired truck and runs inside the house, frantically packing suitcases for his family, knowing that once Marie figures out Hank is dead, she'll go straight to the DEA. Skyler, Jr., and Holly arrive wondering about the strange truck parked in the driveway. Walt comes out of the house throwing his bags inside the truck, telling Jr. and Skyler to immediately pack up their clothes because they need to leave. The family enters the house as Jr. insists to know about what is going on, Walt screams at his son, ordering him to just do as he says, pack what's important and get in the truck. Jr. tries to get the truth about his mother's accusations but falls quiet when Skyler demands to know how Walt is free when Hank had him in custody. Walt tells them he made a deal and everything will be all right if they trust him. Face to face, Skyler realizes that there is only one way that Walt could be free: Hank is dead. She coldly tells Walt "you killed Hank." Walt, in desperation, denies that he killed Hank, and tells her he tried to save him and stresses they must leave immediately if they wish to be safe, Jr. is totally distraught at the idea of Hank being dead. Walt repeats his demand that they pack their things, he rushes Jr. into the bedroom.<br><br><br><br>         Skyler holds a knife against Walt.   <br><br>Meanwhile, Skyler crosses to the kitchen and grabs a knife from the counter, the death of Hank being the last straw. Walt passes by her when returning from the bedroom and she shields Jr. behind herself. With the knife pointed at Walt, she tells him to leave and never to come back. Walt tries to reason with her and asks her to put down the knife, he approaches her and she slashes at him, cutting his right hand. A shocked Walt approaches her again, more quickly this time, stopping her from slashing him again with the knife, but Skyler tries to fight back. Husband and wife tumble into the living room, wrestling for the knife, Jr. screams at them to stop as the struggle escalates, Walter forcefully takes the knife from Skyler, but Jr. tackles Walter off of his mother and shields her from the man he now sees as a maniac. Walt yells at Skyler, asking her what she thinks she's doing, they are supposed to be a family, Walt's expression then changes to regret as he realizes that his whole family is now openly against him. Jr. calls 911 and reports that his father attacked his mother with a knife, and that he might have murdered someone. Walt acts quickly, grabbing Holly from the crib and taking off in his truck. Skyler, in a daze, realizes what he has done and runs out of the house, screaming for Holly as Walt drives away. Walt changes Holly in a restroom and takes care to do it properly, despite his bloodied hand wrapped in duct tape. A blood-stained diaper lies on the sink before Walt throws it in the trash. Walt hugs Holly and she utters one of her first words: "Mama."<br><br><br><br>         Walt orchestrates his emotional phone call as a ploy to release all possible charges and suspicions against Skyler.   <br><br>Back at the White residence, a police officer calls in an Amber Alert for Holly while Skyler, Marie and Jr. are sitting on the couch. Marie is in disbelief about what has transpired, as Hank had had Walter handcuffed and in custody. The phone rings and is answered by the answering machine: it's Walt demanding Skyler to pick up. The police officers in the house instruct her to answer normally, pretending they aren't there as they start tracking where Walt is calling from and recording at the same time. Walt asks Skyler if she is alone or if the police are with her, she follows the policeman's instructions, saying she is alone. Walt, knowing she is lying, pretends that he does not know the police are listening in and proceeds to tell her that he "warned her not to cross him." He also tells her that she should never have told Walt Jr. about his drug business and that she had no idea of the extent of his crimes. He chastises her cruelly for never being grateful for what he's done for the family and calls her a "stupid bitch." Slowly, Skyler begins to realize her husband is deliberately giving her an alibi, and merely responds with an "I'm sorry." He tells her that if she makes one more wrong move, she'll end up just like Hank. She asks about what happened to Hank, Walt starts crying on the other line, but soon recomposes himself, saying that "they are never going to see Hank again, and that he crossed me," horrifying Marie. She breaks down, finally realizing that Hank is truly dead, and is comforted by an equally horrified and heartbroken Walt Jr. Skyler asks Walt to give Holly back. Fighting back tears, Walt responds that he "still has things left to do." At an Albuquerque fire station, a fireman is alerted when he sees a firetruck's lights flashing in the garage. A young fireman enters the truck's cab to shut off the lights and sees a crying Holly in the passenger seat with the White residence address pinned to her. The next day, Walt waits with his luggage and barrel of $11 million for the extractor. The car arrives, Walt packs his things in and they drive off to a supposed start to a new life for Walter.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>This episode has for a long time had the rare rating of a perfect 10/10 on IMDb.<br><br> It now has the outstanding score of 9.9/10 on IMDb. This is the highest rated episode of the series, tied with the last episode "Felina", and in front of the finale of season 4 "Face Off" with 9.8/10. With ~91,000 votes as of November 25, 2017, this is also the most rated episode of Breaking Bad.<br><br>This episode was the series' most-watched episode at the time of its airing with 6.37 million viewers, but was later passed by "Granite State", which had 6.58 million.[1]<br><br>On August 25th, 2014, Moira Walley-Beckett won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for her writing on this episode.<br><br>In a September 13th interview with TV Fanatic Vince Gilligan called the episode "Ozymandias" "the best episode we ever have had or ever will have."<br><br>Guillermo del Toro desperately wanted to direct this episode. When he expressed this desire to the episode's eventual director, Rian Johnson, Johnson responded "Yeah, sorry, I'm the one who gets to fuck the prom queen"<br><br><br><br>The episode is named after the 1818 poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley about the inevitable fall of kings and empires. In addition, Bryan Cranston read the poem in a short promo prior to the episode.<br><br>The poem "Ozymandias" was recited by Bryan Cranston as a promotion for the return of Season 5.<br><br><br><br>Hank Schrader is the third main character to die.<br><br>His death may have been foreshadowed in the episode "One Minute", where he received injuries similar to that of which he got in this episode.<br><br>His death scene was shot in one take.[2]<br><br>This is the final episode to feature all of the show's original cast in new footage, marking the final appearance of Hank who only appears in the series finale during a brief flashback to the pilot episode.<br><br><br><br>The posture Walter falls into after Hank's death is similar to Gus's posture after Max Arciniega's death. Walt and Hank are also brothers-in-law, just like Gus and Max were brothers in some form or another. This is also reminiscent of a picture portrayal of the poem "Ozymandias".<br><br>The pair of pants Walt passes while rolling his barrel are the same pants he lost while driving the RV, at the beginning of the "Pilot".<br><br>The final shot is a stray dog crossing the street after Walt goes into hiding. This is the third of three major "dog" references in the show. The first is in "Problem Dog", where Gale Boetticher is described as such, albeit in metaphor, by Jesse to his therapy group. The second is "Rabid Dog", which describes Jesse as a dog that may have to be killed before he attacks. This final one, the "Stray Dog", is an obvious reference to Walt, who is now homeless and without his family.<br><br>The actor who plays the firefighter that discovers Holly is Noah Segan, who has had starring roles in two of Rian Johnson's films, Brick (2005) and Looper (2012).<br><br>Walt abducts Holly just like Marie tried to do a few episodes before.<br><br>The Koala Kare changing station logo seen when Walt is changing Holly can also be seen in episode 501, "Live Free or Die", when Walt is purchasing the M60 from Lawson.  <br><br>In an interview, director Rian Johnson revealed that Holly's crying "Mama" in the bathroom scene was unscripted. The baby's mother was standing behind Bryan Cranston on set, and the baby locked eyes with her and started saying "mama" over and over again. Cranston simply went with it and the shot ended up in the episode.<br><br>During the game of chess between the firemen, the white king is cornered, but not checkmated or even in check. The king is simply going behind another pawn, buying time, but not advancing the game. The only remaining white pieces are a Knight (not a Queen) and two pawns.<br><br><br><br>When Walter looks at the bullet holes in his car, the reflection of him in the metal puts a hole in his forehead.<br><br>The flashback at the beginning of the episode is full of symbols echoing the terrifying end of it:<br><br>Skyler packs and ships away a white statue of a clown crying blood belonging to Walt, that she's been able to sell for more dollars than Walt bought it, and that they both find now ugly. This symbolizes the end of the episode, when Walter White, sad clown with bloodied hands, is sent away by Skyler with his money, and everyone being disgusted by him.<br><br>They discuss the name of their upcoming child that Walt will abduct at the end of the episode.<br><br>The knives that Skyler will later use against Walt are conveniently set on the table, their handles offered in her direction.<br><br>Walt suggests a short break for the family the next weekend, like he will "suggest" they all pack up and leave for no return at the end.<br><br><br><br>Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) and Laura Fraser (Lydia Rodarte-Quayle) do not appear in this episode.<br><br>In a possible continuity error, the phone number for the White residence's land line in this episode differs from that shown on Skyler's divorce application papers in "Más".<br><br>Continuity error: The extractor's van picks up Walt at John B. Robert Dam in Northeast Albuquerque. When the van arrives, a long shot reveals that it is on Juan Tabo Boulevard, a 4 lane road, and is driving north. Walt enters the van, and when it starts moving, it is suddenly on a 2 lane road driving west, where Juan Tabo travels north and south. <br><br>Unusually, the cast and crew credits do not appear onscreen until after the second commercial break, to avoid interfering with the intensity of the first act.<br><br>Walt wrote down the coordinates of his stash - which became the location of Hank and Gomez's bodies - to the second (as in degrees, minutes, seconds). But plus-or-minus half a second of latitude and longitude describes a rectangle about 100x80 feet. The DEA would find the grave eventually, but the neo-Nazis were lucky to hit pay dirt so quickly.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (credit only)<br><br>Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (credit only)<br><br>Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br> Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez (corpse)<br><br> Michael Bowen as Jack Welker<br><br> Kevin Rankin as Kenny<br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Patrick Sane as Frankie<br><br> Tait Fletcher as Lester<br><br> Matthew T.

Maybe now you’ll use your damn head. You know, you never believed in me. You were never grateful for anything I did for this family. “Oh, no.  Walt, Walt, you have to stop.  You have to stop this. It’s immoral. It’s illegal. Someone might get hurt.” You’re always whining and complaining about how I make my money, just dragging me down while I do everything. And now–now you tell my son what I do after I’ve told you and told you to keep your damn mouth shut.  You stupid bitch!

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Just as seen at the end of the previous episode, the extractor's red van drives off from the side of the road after picking up its passenger. Shortly afterward, it arrives at a vacuum repair shop. The extractor, a man named Ed, drives the van into the shop and we see that instead of Walter White, Ed tells Saul Goodman to get out. Saul is amused to learn that Ed's cover story about being a vacuum cleaner repairman is real. Ed takes a photo of Saul and starts working on Saul's new Nebraska ID. He says that Saul will have to wait at least two days to be extracted out of the state, since his face is well known in Albuquerque, and that in the meantime Saul will be staying in a downstairs bunker with another person awaiting extraction. Knowing the person is Walter White, Saul asks Ed how Walt is doing. Ed shows him a monitor screen with live footage of an impatient Walt angrily pacing around the bunker and slapping a ceiling lamp.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Jack Welker's White Supremacist Gang watch Jesse's confession video.   <br><br>SAC Ramey and two DEA Agents are driving a distraught Marie Schrader home, still in shock from the news that Hank is dead; on the way, he promises that they will find Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez (though what he really means is that they will recover their bodies and give them a proper burial). When they arrive at the Schrader house, they find that somebody has broken in, raided and trashed the place. One agent drives a shocked Marie away as Ramey and the other agent investigate the premises. It is revealed that the White Supremacists have broken in and stolen Jesse Pinkman's confession DVD ("Rabid Dog"). At night, in the neo-Nazis' compound, Kenny is showing Jack Welker and the rest of the gang the footage of the DVD, as there's something important they need to see. Kenny fast-forwards the video to the moment that Jesse reveals Todd Alquist's murder of that "missing" kid Drew Sharp. Throughout the whole thing, Todd shows no emotion whatsoever, and actually appears slightly prideful at the description of his murder of Drew Sharp. Upon hearing this, Jack prepares to kill his prisoner, but Todd pleads with him to keep Jesse alive so they can cook more meth since they still have all that methylamine they took. Jack wonders why they need to make and sell more meth, i.e. make more money, since they already have most of Walt's millions; but Jesse is a rat and needs to be put down. He eventually realizes Todd wants to keep going with the meth production because he's attracted to Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, and needs a continuing meth supply for her Czech clients, as this is the only way Todd can keep in contact with her. After joking about the situation, "one can't help who one is sweet on", Jack decides to let Jesse live for his nephew's sake. The gang head back inside to continue watching Jesse's confession. Meanwhile, in his cage, Jesse is now in possession of the photo of Andrea Cantillo and Brock Cantillo from the lab. Attached to the photo is a paperclip, which he unhinges and attempts to unlock his handcuffs with.<br><br><br><br>         Walt attempts to intimidate Saul once more.   <br><br>In Ed's bunker, Walt is making plans to get revenge on Jack and the White Supremacists for killing Hank and stealing his money(despite them saving him from imprisonment). He asks Saul for a list of trustable mercenaries that can help them with the job. Instead, Saul advises Walt to stay and turn himself in so Skyler White can go free, otherwise the police will squeeze her for everything until she gives Walt up, which she can't do, since she doesn't know where Walt is. Saul points out that, given that Walt is already dying, it would be better to turn himself in. The Feds just won't give up, given that two DEA agents are missing and presumed dead (especially since one of them was the ASAC and a public hero), and that they will throw everything they've got at Skyler, essentially making Walt's entire family outcasts from society, unable to get any job whatsoever.  Ed comes calling for Saul, whose ride to Nebraska has arrived, while Walt will have to wait a little longer. Walt interrupts, saying that there is a change of plans: Saul is coming with him. Saul refuses, saying that he is no longer a lawyer but just a normal civilian trying to make a living in an honest way to get a nice retirement. Walt changes his expression to pure wrath and slowly approaches Saul, making him back up against the wall in a similar way as he did in the first episode of the season ("Live Free or Die"), but before Walt can finish his sentence, he erupts into a severe coughing fit and collapses onto the bed. No longer intimidated, Saul tells Walt "It's over!", grabs his bags and leaves.<br><br><br><br>         Skyler is threatened by the White Supremacist Gang.   <br><br>Skyler meets with the Assistant United States Attorney and members of the DEA, including SAC Ramey, who push her for information about Walt's drug activities and her involvement in it. She tells them she can't help them even if she wanted to as she has absolutely no idea where Walt is. They, perhaps not believing her, insist that she consult with her attorney and think hard to come up with something they can use. At night, Skyler sits at home and looks out of her window at two DEA agents working surveillance in a car on her street. She goes to check on Holly White inside the bedroom and finds masked men (Todd and other White Supremacists) menacingly looming over Holly's crib. One of the neo-Nazis grabs Skyler and covers her mouth preventing her from screaming. Todd approaches and tells Skyler that they respect her husband a lot, so they are only passing by to leave a message: it's in her and her children's best interest to forget about "the black-haired lady at the car wash" (Lydia). The police can never hear about her involvement with Walt. After Skyler promises that she has not and will not say anything, the neo-Nazis leave the house, leaving Skyler severely shaken. The next day at a café, Lydia and Todd meet back-to-back, with Lydia insisting that, despite Todd's assurances to the contrary, intimidation is not enough to silence Skyler: she best be eliminated. Lydia wants to call the partnership off but Todd tells her that, with Jesse cooking for them, they have reached 92% purity, as well as the signature blue color. He also tells her that he values their partnership, and Lydia reconsiders.<br><br><br><br>         Walt collects his money at New Hampshire.   <br><br>Walt is transported while sitting in the tank of a propane truck. Arriving in the middle of a snowy, forested reservation, Ed lets Walt out and says, "Mr. Lambert, welcome to New Hampshire" ("Live Free or Die"). Walt enters his new home — a cabin with no external utilities. Ed says he'll return monthly for grocery runs in exchange for tens of thousands of dollars. Walt complains about living here with no electricity or contact with anyone. Ed informs him that if he leaves the cabin's surrounding two-acre property, he will get caught, as his face is all over national news. Furthermore, Ed tells Walt that if he ever leaves the property, "I won't be coming back. That is for my own safety." Ed takes off and suggests Walt take the opportunity to clear his head. Once he's alone, the first thing Walt does is stuff his pockets with bundles of cash and prepares to leave, but he stops and remembers something he brought with him inside one of the bags. He opens the bag and takes out his Heisenberg pork pie hat. He dons the hat and goes outside, heading to his property's gate. He opens it, but stops and looks at the long, snowy road ahead ... "Tomorrow," Walt mutters to himself, returning to the cabin and lighting a fire instead.<br><br><br><br>         Andrea is shot dead as a result of Jesse's failed escape attempt.   <br><br>Jesse uses the paperclip to unlock his hand- & ankle-cuffs, and tries to reach the cage bars above his head. Hearing Todd approaching, he quickly puts the cuffs back on and pretends to be resting. Bringing Jesse some ice cream to celebrate their latest 96% pure batch, Todd congratulates him and tells him to get ready to cook another batch in the morning. After Todd leaves, Jesse frees himself again and manages to escape the cage. He heads to the fences, but unknowingly runs past a security video camera and is caught by the white supremacists while trying to climb the fence. Refusing to cook meth for them anymore, Jesse tells them to just kill him. Instead, they take Jesse, bound and gagged, to Andrea's house. Todd walks to the front door and rings the doorbell. Andrea answers and believes Todd's story that he is a friend of Jesse's and brought him to see her. Jesse, terrified and horrified, despairingly tries to scream from inside the car to alert her, but Andrea is unable to see him before Todd pulls a silenced pistol out and shoots her in the head from behind. Jesse wails with remorse as he witnesses her drop to the ground, dead; as Jack tells him, "Remember, there's still the kid." Jesse continues to cry uncontrollably, wracked with sadness and guilt, likely both at Andrea's death because of his actions, and that Brock is now an orphan because of it.<br><br><br><br>         Ed performs makeshift chemotherapy for Walt.   <br><br>Months later, Walt walks up to his property's gate as Ed arrives for another supply drop, and eagerly lets him in. Walt now has a beard and full (albeit patchy) head of hair. Walt's vision is going bad so he grabs a new pair of glasses from a selection box Ed brought him, since he didn't know his prescription. He avidly reads through newspapers from Albuquerque, looking for articles about himself and his family. Ed tells him Skyler is living in a place just off of Eubank, working as a part-time taxi dispatcher, still has custody of both children, and is now using her maiden name. Walt's now-abandoned house has become a macabre tourist attraction, and due to the neighbors' complaints the bank has erected a fence around the house. Ed then hooks up a homemade chemotherapy rig for Walt, injecting him with a drip, then prepares to leave, saying that he has a long trip ahead of him. Out of loneliness, Walt asks him to please stay a little longer, even offering an extra $10,000 for another two hours. Ed agrees to stay for a single hour (for the $10,000), and the two play seven-card stud to pass the time. Seemingly resigned to his likely fate, Walt asks Ed if he would give the barrel of money to his family when he dies. Ed replies, "If I said yes, would you believe me?" Walt doesn't reply, but it's clear in his eyes that he probably wouldn't. Later, alone again, Walt wakes to the sound of his wedding band falling off his thinning finger. After looping a string through it and making a necklace, Walt spots the box of Ensure Ed left on the counter in an attempt to help fatten him. He empties the box and fills it with $100,000 from his money barrel. In the morning, Walt heads toward the property gate once again, but this time he leaves the reservation and walks along the snow-covered road to the nearest town and pub.<br><br><br><br>         Walter Jr. receives a call from his dad.   <br><br>At the J. P. Wynne High School, Walter Jr. is called out of class by Principal Carmen. She takes him to her office and tells him that his aunt Marie is calling and it seems to be important. When Jr. answers the phone, it is actually Walt on the other line, calling from a tavern in New Hampshire and having paid a barfly to pose as Marie on the phone. Walt instructs his son not to alert anyone and tries to explain his actions, but is unable to quite find the words, attempting to explain that a lot happened that wasn't his intention. Walt checks if Louis Corbett still lives at the same address, and tells Jr. that he will mail Louis a package containing $100,000, which Jr. can pick up. Walt tells him to keep it a secret or the police will take it. The money is for him, his mother, and his sister, which is all he ever intended. "It can't all be for nothing," Walt cries, "Please!" However, distraught that Walt is trying to send them his 'ill-gained' money, Jr. begins yelling at his father, repeatedly saying, "You killed Uncle Hank!" Refusing to accept his help, Jr. furiously wishes Walt dead - "Why are you still alive? Just die already. Just die!" - then hangs up. Defeated, Walt calls the DEA office in Albuquerque and asks to speak with the agent in charge of the Walter White case; when the receptionist asks who is calling, Walt gives his true name and leaves the phone off the hook so they can trace the call and send police to arrest him.<br><br><br><br>         Elliot and Gretchen talk to Charlie Rose.              <br><br>Walt walks to the bartender and orders a Dimple Pinch Scotch whiskey, neat. While Walt is drinking, something on the television catches his interest while the bartender flips through the channels. Gretchen Schwartz and Elliott Schwartz are being interviewed by Charlie Rose, who asks them about their recent donation of $28 million to fund drug rehab clinics throughout the American Southwest. Rose asks if they made the donation to make amends for "your association with Walter White," who helped start their very successful and profitable technology company Gray Matter Technologies, now worth over $2 billion. Both claim that Walt has not been associated with Gray Matter since its earliest days. When asked what Walt's contribution to the company was, Elliott untruthfully says that it was "essentially nothing." Gretchen agrees, saying the only thing Walt contributed was the company's name. Elliott explains: Schwartz (German for black) plus White equals Gray. Rose next asserts that Walt's iconic blue methamphetamine is still circulating in the southwestern United States and has even been seen in Europe, implying that Walter White is still active and that Elliott and Gretchen must know something about this.<br><br><br><br>         Walt's unfinished Dimple Pinch.   <br><br>As Walter watches the television interview and listens to Elliott and Gretchen's lies, he becomes increasingly and visibly angry. Gretchen says she can't speak for the "Heisenberg" person, but that Walter White, "the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once long ago knew - he's gone." Walt, his face hardening and jaws clenching in anger, has a change of heart on hearing his old girlfriend's words. Four Crawford County Sheriff's Deputies arrive at the tavern with their guns drawn, but Walt has already left, his unfinished Dimple Pinch and a crushed napkin sitting on the bar.<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7730017730012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>This episode was the series' most-watched episode at the time of its airing with 6.58 million U.S. viewers, but was later passed by "Felina", which had 10.28 million.[1]<br><br>This is the first episode in the series to take place in a snowy, "white" atmosphere. Also mirroring the theme of change in the series.<br><br>Vince Gilligan originally planned to direct this episode along with "Felina" but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. <br><br>The "Granite State" is New Hampshire, where Ed sends Walt to start his new life. This was alluded to in the first episode of the season, where Walt's fake ID says he is from New Hampshire. ("Live Free or Die")<br><br>During the production for the episode, the footage of Walt's phone call to Walter Jr. had to be filmed again because the footage from the first time was accidently crushed by a 737 after the footage fell out of a truck. Ironically, this is the same plane model as one of the planes from the Wayfarer 515 incident in "ABQ".<br><br>The bar and cabin in New Hampshire are set in the fictional Crawford County in the White Mountain region. However, There is a well-known mountain pass called "Crawford Notch" that crosses the White Mountains, to which this name probably refers. Various New England writers explored Crawford Notch, including Nathaniel Hawthorne.<br><br>In Breaking Bad Insider Podcast of this episode, Peter Gould told a rather funny story on the bar scene. A Police Tech Adviser asked them "What are you gonna do with the Cactus ?". The production did not realize that there was a cactus right in front of the bar, so they ended up painting it white.<br><br>The hockey game shown on the bar TV was from Feburary 13th, 1998. Wisconsin played Denver at Wisconsin and won 7-4[2].<br><br>PBS talk show host Charlie Rose makes a cameo appearance as himself in this episode. This was revealed by him during his August 8, 2013 episode that featured Anna Gunn, Vince Gilligan, Aaron Paul, and Bryan Cranston as guests. <br><br>In the interview, Charlie Rose references a New York Times column written by Andrew Ross Sorkin. The column was actually written and an excerpt appears on the New York Times website.<br><br>This is the only episode in the series that contains the full version of the "Breaking Bad Theme" scored by Dave Porter. It plays in the final scene, while the police are raiding the bar in New Hamsphire.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Walt regains his hair for the first time since Season 1's "Crazy Handful of Nothin'".<br><br>Skyler spaces out while discussing with the lawyers the same way Walter spaced out in while receiving the news of his cancer. ("Pilot")<br><br>Walt and Skyler still have the same last names since Walt was named Lambert and Skyler goes by her maiden name, which is Lambert too.<br><br> Although he doesn't physically appear on screen, we hear Hank say "Now, this is Todd Alquist we're talking about?" during the recording of Jesse's confession.<br><br>When Ed is dealing out playing cards for him and Walt to play stud, he deals two kings, referring to the two men playing cards. This continues the theme of a king from the prior episode "Ozymandias". In that episode, a close up of a white king on the chessboard in the fire station is zoomed in on, and also the title Ozymandias, refers to a king that has lost all his power and glory.<br><br>In Ed's bunker, Saul says "If I'm lucky, a month from now, best case scenario, I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha." This is exactly where he ends up in the pilot episode of Better Call Saul. <br><br> Saul tells Walt that Skyler and the kids got RICOed out of their house after Walt's crimes were uncovered, just as he said would happen if Skyler gave him up in "Caballo Sin Nombre".<br><br>Walt's unsuccessful attempt to intimidate Saul early in this episode is a clear reference to his successful intimidation of him in "Live Free or Die".<br><br>This is Saul's last appearance on Breaking Bad, though Bob Odenkirk is still credited as main cast member for the series finale.<br><br><br><br>When Todd kills Andrea, the scene of Jesse screaming in agony in the truck is very reminiscent of Gus's agony cries when Max Arciniega is killed, and Walt's cries when Hank is killed. The camera angle is very similar and the head positioning of Jesse is similiar as well, along with the uncontrolled misery in the cries. Walt and Gus were both lying down with their heads turned sideways, while Jesse begins sitting up, but then lies down partially against the door, and then finally for a moment is lying fully down with his face turned as Gus and Walt's were.<br><br>Andrea is the second romantic interest of Jesse's to die in the series, the first being Jane. Jesse also learns the truth about Walt's role in Jane's death in the previous episode.<br><br>Walt is also responsible (albeit indirectly) for Andrea's death, as he attempted to use her as bait to draw out Jesse in "To'hajiilee", which is how Jack's gang knew to use her as leverage against Jesse.<br><br><br><br>Walt packs his money in an Ensure box to "ensure" his family's financial security after he dies.<br><br>Walt Jr.'s last words to his father in this episode are similar to his words to him in "Cancer Man", "Why don't you just die already?", and are also the last words they will have before the death of Walt.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader (voice only)<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman<br><br>Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle<br><br>Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Emily Rios as Andrea Cantillo<br><br> Michael Bowen as Jack Welker<br><br> Kevin Rankin as Kenny<br><br> Adam Godley as Elliott Schwartz<br><br> Jessica Hecht as Gretchen Schwartz<br><br><br><br><br><br> Carmen Serano as Carmen Molina<br><br> Brennan Brown as US Attorney<br><br> Eric Price as Skyler's lawyer<br><br> Robert Forster as Ed<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Todd Terry as ASAC Ramey<br><br> Patrick Sane as Frankie<br><br> Tait Fletcher as Lester<br><br> Matthew T.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Series Finale poster   <br><br>With police searching for him in New Hampshire, Walter White finds an unlocked car, its windows covered in snow, and gets inside. Suffering from the cold weather, he searches for something to start the engine. In the glove compartment, he finds a Marty Robbins music tape and a screwdriver. He tries to use the screwdriver to start the car, but fails after several attempts. The flickering lights of a police car appear, though Walt can't be seen from outside because of the icy snow covering all the windows. As a flashlight passes over the car, Walt quietly pleads, "Just get me home. I'll do the rest." The police car leaves without further inspection, and after a moment of intuition, the car keys drop from the visor into his lap. He starts the car, knocks the snow off the windows, and begins his drive back to Albuquerque.<br><br><br><br>Summary<br><br>         Walt sets a meeting with his former business partners.   Somewhere in the New Mexico desert, Walt is driving down the road when he stops at a gas station to fill up the tank. He uses a pay phone and poses as a journalist from the New York Times doing a story on Elliott Schwartz and Gretchen Schwartz; he says that he will send his photographer to take some pictures for the newspaper and asks for the Schwartzes' new address. He also learns that they are getting back home that night from their interview with Charlie Rose in New York. After thanking for the information and hanging up, Walt leaves his watch — the birthday gift from Jesse Pinkman ("Fifty-One") — on top of the phone booth and takes off.<br><br>Later that night, Elliott and Gretchen come home to their luxurious country residence talking about pizzas and their common interests, all flirty with each other that they fail to spot Walt sitting half in shadow by the garden just waiting for their arrival. As the Schwartzes walk to the kitchen to prepare dinner, Walt closes the main door and follows them inside the house. Amused by the luxury, Walt analyzes some pictures on a counter as Gretchen walks into the living room and screams as she spots him. Elliott comes to her aid and Walt casually greets the couple and compliments their impressive new home. Walt mentions that the couple must have a great view of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains because of their location. He tells them that he watched their interview on Charlie Rose and says that he has "something" for them in his car, asking them to help him unload it. Elliott tries to protect Gretchen with a small cheese knife but Walt just scoffs, "Elliot if we're gonna go that way, you'll need a bigger knife." Gretchen cowers behind a now wide eyed Elliott, who on second thought thinks it best to just drop the useless knife altogether.<br><br><br><br>         Walt threatens Elliot and Gretchen.   <br><br>Minutes later, the three of them finish bringing the $9.72 million in cash from Walt's trunk and pile the last of it on the coffee table. Walt tells them exactly how much money there is and that the Schwartzes will give it to Walter Jr. on his 18th birthday in ten months time, set up as an irrevocable trust fund. Gretchen scoffs, saying that it would make no sense for them to give Walt's family all that money for no reason, but Walt explains that they're already giving millions to help recovering addicts and it would make total sense for them to support his son because of his "monstrous father," who used to be their friend. Walt orders Elliott and Gretchen not to pay any taxes or legal fees with their own money.  They must use Walt's money only and his hope is that Walter Jr. will use the money for college and to take care of Skyler and Holly. Walt shakes hands with the couple to confirm the deal, asking them if he can trust them to do this. As they nod yes, he turns to the window and signals outside to two "assassins", who train their laser sights on Elliott and Gretchen, much to their horror. Walt informs the distraught couple that he took $200,000 from the barrel to hire the two best hit men west of the Mississippi:  He warns them that, regardless of what happens to him - whether he's dead, in prison, or on the run - the hit men will be keeping tabs on them, and if Walter Jr. does not get the money on his birthday, for any reason whatsoever, they will both die, probably when they least expect it. He gives Elliott and Gretchen a "friendly" shoulder squeeze and tells them this is their chance to make things right. Then he signals again and the assassins turn off their lasers. and he leaves the house.<br><br>Down the street from the Schwartzes' house, Walt stops his car and picks up the "assassins," who turn out to be Jesse's two former sidekicks, Skinny Pete and Badger, who give Walt back the two laser pointers used to threaten Elliott and Gretchen. The two say they feel somewhat uncomfortable with what they just did. Walt gives them $10,000 each and they instantly feel better. Walt asks them if it's true that Blue Sky is still being manufactured and distributed, which they confirm, thinking that the manufacturer was Walt all this time. Walt determines that Jesse is still alive and cooking much to Skinny Pete and Badger's shock as they thought Jesse had moved to Alaska.<br><br><br><br>         Jesse remains as a meth slave-cook for the White Supremacist Gang.   <br><br>In a dreamlike moment, a younger and happier Jesse is finishing a wooden box for his woodworking class back in high school ("Kafkaesque"). The box is perfect and Jesse enjoys the smell of it as he gives it the final touches, and the memory of joy and pride it left him with. A second later he's jolted from this daydream, bearded and scarred, still a prisoner of the White Supremacist Gang, cooking meth for them in the warehouse at the end of a chain.<br><br>The following day — Walt's 52nd birthday — Walt stops by a Denny's to meet with Lawson and purchases the M60 machine gun ("Live Free or Die")  and later drives back to his old home, now abandoned and in ruins, to retrieve the ricin hidden inside the bedroom switch plate ("Blood Money"). Before leaving the house, Walt stops in the middle of the empty living room and reminisces about his 50th birthday, when Hank Schrader invited him for a DEA ride-along that catalyzed his journey into the meth business ("Pilot").<br><br><br><br>         Walt's discussion with Lydia and Todd as a ploy to poison Lydia with ricin.   <br><br>Lydia Rodarte-Quayle enters her usual café with luggage, orders a chamomile tea, and picks out the last Stevia packet from her table. Todd Alquist joins her shortly after and they start a conversation where Todd awkwardly tries to compliment Lydia's clothes (and in her eyes failing miserably.) Suddenly, Walt pulls up a chair and joins them, telling them that he only needs two minutes to give them a new offer. Lydia is frightened and tries to leave, but Walt holds her by the arm and begs for just two minutes of her time. She gets back in her chair and Walt tells them that he can do the math and he knows they are almost out of methylamine.  He tells them that he's found a way to cook meth without the methylamine, and he is willing to teach Todd this new formula for only $1 million which he says is nothing compared to what they would earn. Walt informs them that he needs the money as soon as possible because he's almost broke from trying to keep ahead of the authorities. Lydia asks Walt how he knew to find them there and he points out that Lydia is a creature of habit and that they used to have this same meeting at the same time every week ("Gliding Over All"). Lydia tells Walt that he can meet with the neo-Nazis to discuss the subject further. Todd tries to protest but Lydia interrupts him, saying that the meeting will happen during the evening. When the waiter returns with Lydia's tea, she asks what Walt and Todd would like to order, but Lydia says that Walt is just leaving. He gets up and walks out of the café. As Lydia stirs her Stevia into her tea, she tells Todd that they can't indulge Walt's request for their own safety. Lydia insinuates that the best thing to do is to kill Walt, which she includes, would only be doing him a favor, considering his physical condition.<br><br>In the New Mexican desert, Walt's M60 and instruction booklet are laid out as he builds a device with a garage door opener connected to a car battery. He switches on the machine remotely with his car lock remote. The contraption starts rotating back and forth and he smiles in approval. He then notices his wedding band, hanging from his makeshift necklace, and focuses on his next course of action.<br><br><br><br>         Walt says his farewell to Skyler.   <br><br>Skyler White sits in her cramped apartment, smoking a cigarette. Marie Schrader calls and tells her that Walt is back in town; the vehicle he stole in New Hampshire was found parked at the local Denny's. She also reports Walt was spotted by their old neighbor Carol, walking out of the White's abandoned house and greeting her like nothing was wrong ("Blood Money"). Skyler asks if Walt hurt anyone and Marie states that as far as the police know nothing has happened until now. However, many absurd phone calls are being made to the DEA. Marie tells Skyler she is sure that there are only three things Walt would be after back in Albuquerque: Herself, Jr., or Skyler. Marie tells her that some agents are coming to watch her house and another group is watching Jr.'s school in case Walt shows up. She then tells Skyler to be vigilant and safe, then hangs up. The camera pans to reveal that Walt was inside the room the entire time and Skyler tells him that he has five minutes. He tells her that whatever happens by the end of the day, he wanted to give her a proper goodbye and that his last phone call to her ("Ozymandias") was no way to end things. Skyler worries that Walt's return will put her in danger again, telling him about the masked men who threatened her ("Granite State"). Walt assures Skyler that, after tonight, those men won't bother her any more. She asks if Walt is going to turn himself in to the police and Walt confirms that "the police will come for me." He also decides to tell Skyler his motive for cooking meth but she interrupts him, complaining that she doesn't want to hear that he did it for the family even one more time. Walt surprises her by finally admitting the truth: he'd done it for his own sake. He tells her he built his Drug Empire for himself because he liked it and because he was good at it and ultimately because it made him feel alive. Having the weight of that guilt lifted off her shoulders, Skyler's whole face softens, lit up by Walt finally being truthful with her. A modicum of pity, love and understanding creeps into her eyes too. He gives Skyler the lottery ticket ("Buried") and tells her to call the police as soon as he leaves. She must tell the police that he broke into her apartment, ordered her to make bacon and eggs for his birthday, and gave her that lottery ticket. He tells her the numbers on the ticket are GPS coordinates that will take them to the burial site of Hank and Steven Gomez. Then explains how the men who stole his money killed and buried Hank and Steve in the same hole they unearthed the barrels from. He tells her to trade this information for a deal with the DEA to finally clear her of any possible accusations so she can go on with her life. As a final request, Walt asks to see Holly one last time, which Skyler allows. She looks at Walt sadly as he lovingly caresses his daughter for the last time. After leaving the place, Walt watches from afar as Walt Jr. comes home from school and without disturbing him, he savours the last glimpse of his son as he too quickly enters the apartment and shuts the door behind him. Walt walks off crestfallen, easily giving the slip to the surveillance agents parked nearby.<br><br><br><br>         Walt meets with Jack.   <br><br>That night, Walt drives to the neo-Nazi's compound and is greeted by Kenny, who is amused by Walt's newly acquired vehicle. He drives into the compound as Kenny tells him to park the car next to the others, but instead Walt parks the car parallel to the front of the main building opposite the window. Kenny wonders why Walt does this but dismisses it and gets out with Walt, happy for him to park wherever. Walt is frisked by Frankie, and his keys and wallet are taken from him, they also make Walt lift up his shirt and spin around to show them he's not wearing any wires. They enter the building and Walt is greeted by Jack Welker, who sarcastically compliments Walt's head of hair, inquiring if it's really his own, but saying the rest of him "looks like shit." Walt asks Jack if they have a deal for his new meth-cooking method, but Jack informs him that they are not even in the business anymore. Walt knows that Jack is lying, he insists that soon they will run out of methylamine, and they won't be able to produce the required product they need. Walt tries to get some support from Todd, but Todd apologizes and says they can't do anything to help Walt. Jack laughingly declines the offer, saying Lydia can get them more methylamine from Madrigal Electromotive whenever they need it. Todd menacingly tells Walt that he shouldn't have come back, as Kenny puts a gun to his head. Jack tells Kenny to kill Walt anywhere but his living room. Before they can take him outside and kill him, Walt shouts for them to wait and insults Jack, calling him a liar because he hasn't killed Jesse like he was hired to do. Accusing him of partnering with Jesse who Walt knows is cooking the gang's meth. Infuriated by Walt's accusation, Jack says he is going to show Walt just how much of a "partner" Jesse really is. He orders Todd to bring Jesse in to prove Walt wrong. Todd says that they can't bring him out of the meth lab because he is busy cooking a batch. But Jack angrily tells Todd to hurry up so they can be done with this, after which he tells Walt that he will personally shoot Walt in the head.<br><br><br><br>         Walt's M60 machine gun, concealed within his trunk, opens fire.   <br><br>Todd takes Jesse, bound in handcuffs and ankle shackles, out of the meth lab and the two head for the main building. Meanwhile, Jack and the others are waiting with Walt inside the gang's clubhouse. During this distraction, Walt is able to discreetly retrieve the car keys with the remote control from the pool table behind him. Jesse is brought to the room and Jack tells Walt to take a good look at Jesse, saying that he'd never partner with a rat. Walt approaches the ragged Jesse, inspecting his former partner. Understanding that Jesse is a captive, and not willingly complicit in the gang's meth production, Walt feigns anger and tackles Jesse to the floor. The neo-Nazis are amused and start laughing at the struggle. Kenny jokes as Todd tries to get Walt off of Jesse, but Walt pushes the trunk-open button on the car remote control. Outside, the trunk of the car opens, exposing the mounted machine gun. It automatically starts to open fire, oscillating on the garage door opener's motor, and rips through the vehicle and building. The rain of bullets causes mayhem inside the clubhouse room, quickly killing Kenny, Frankie, Matt and Lester. Todd is already on the ground with Walter and Jesse, safe from the gunfire, but Jack is seriously injured by a bullet to the abdomen. Walt covers Jesse as the machine gun continues to fire bullets through the wall and windows cutting through everyone that was standing. After the M60 runs out of ammo, Todd crawls to the window in a daze, wondering who's shooting at them. Jesse jumps up and starts to strangle Todd with the chain of his handcuffs completely full of rage for his captivity and murdering Andrea. The two men struggle on the ground as Walt watches but does nothing to interfere. Todd struggles, but Jesse perseveres until Todd's breath runs out and his body falls limp, finally avenging Andrea. As Jesse searches Todd's pockets for the keys to his handcuffs, Walt slowly gets up and grabs a handgun that Jack had dropped. He approaches the now bleeding and defenseless neo-Nazi leader who is lying on the floor. Jack casually grabs his cigarette dropped nearby, begs Walt to wait while he nonchalantly takes a puff on it, then tries to bargain for his life. He tells Walt he's obviously here for his money, but that he'll never find his millions if he pulls the trigger. Walt interrupts him with a bullet to the head, avenging Hank's murder.<br><br><br><br>         Walt asks Jesse to shoot him.   <br><br>Jesse frantically unlocks his hand-and foot-cuffs and stands up, now facing Walt, who still has the pistol in hand. After an intense and silent stare, Walt slides his gun to his former student, who somewhat puzzled picks it up and aims it at Walt. Walt nods and urges him to do it - "you want this" - to which Jesse replies that he won't pull the trigger unless Walt says that he wants it. Walt obliges and admits "I want this," yet Jesse still finds it impossible to pull the trigger. Just then he notices Walt is bleeding from his side revealing that Walt was shot by a round from his own M60. He drops the gun and tells Walt to do it himself. As Jesse is walking out, Todd's phone starts ringing. Walt searches for it in Todd's pockets and answers the call. On the line, a seriously ill Lydia is calling Todd to ask if Walt has been killed yet. As Jesse looks for the keys to Todd's car, Walt says "it's done!" - then relishes in telling her that Todd and the entire White Supremacist gang are gone, and that it's Walt on the line. An alarmed Lydia perks up shocked, as Walt asks if she is feeling "under the weather," as if she has the flu? He then reveals that he poisoned her with ricin, putting it in the "Stevia crap" that she put in her tea earlier at the café. Lydia is horrified by this news and starts to panic as Walt calmly says goodbye and throws the phone to the ground, knowing she is about to die.<br><br>Jesse and Walt share one last look of gratitude, Jesse seemingly forgiving Walt, as the two men nod farewell to one another. Jesse gets in Todd's car and ecstatically plows through the gates of the compound to freedom, laughing and crying hysterically; hardly believing he made it out alive. He keeps his foot down and speeds down the road as fast as he can to parts unknown finally free of the drug cartels and able to resume his life without danger.<br><br><br><br>         Walt succumbs to his injury and dies.   <br><br>Blood drips from Walt's abdomen, soaking his shirt. As the police lights approach in the distance, Walt walks into the compound's meth lab which contains Declan's old empire's industrial chemical equipment. It has been almost a year since he set foot in a meth lab. Jesse was interrupted during a cook, so Walt walks among the equipment, nostalgically tapping gauges and checking temperatures as he reminisces over his glory days of cooking. He makes no adjustments; Jesse is cooking a perfect batch of meth - Walt has succeeded as both a chemist and a teacher. At his last dying minute, he braces himself on a tank with a bloody hand, leaving a vaguely W-shaped blood red smear print on the shiny stainless steel surface, as the reflection of tears and the smile on his face drop down, as he falls to the floor. Flat on his back, his last moments amongst his beloved lab equipment, content with his last love being for what he made expertly, and what he felt alive for as Heisenberg. Knowing that his family is safe and financially secure, Walt dies serenely staring at the ceiling with his arms spread out from his body in a quasi-crucifixion pose. Walter Hartwell White is found dead by a group of police officers, ironically, in the same place where he most and last felt alive [a chemistry lab].<br><br><br><br>Official Photos<br><br>JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760027760012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js","type":"js"},{"url":"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7760027760012/sass/background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fbreakingbad%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20170411111858%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D1700%26color-body%3D%2523003715%26color-body-middle%3D%2523ffffff%26color-buttons%3D%2523002612%26color-community-header%3D%2523002612%26color-header%3D%2523ffffff%26color-links%3D%2523337800%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss","type":"css"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})<br><br>Trivia<br><br>This episode has the outstanding score of 9.9/10 on IMDb. This is the highest rated episode of the series, tied with the "Ozymandias", but the latter has more votes with ~91000 against ~62000 as of November 25, 2017.<br><br>The title "Felina" is a reference to the 1959 song "El Paso" by Western music artist Marty Robbins. The song concerns an unnamed cowboy who falls in love with a woman named Faleena, gets shot by his enemies, and dies in her arms. The song plays in Walt's stolen car in New Hampshire, and is later hummed by Walt as he assembles the M60.<br><br>"Felina" is an anagram for "finale", and is also the feminine version of the word "feline" in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.<br><br>That "Felina" is a portmanteau of "Fe", "Li" and "Na", the symbols for iron, lithium and sodium, or shorthand for "blood, meth and tears" is a common misconception. Methamphetamines do not contain lithium.<br><br><br><br> This is the second longest episode of the series (55 minutes), only surpassed by the pilot (58 minutes).<br><br>This is the fourth episode to be written and directed by Vince Gilligan, after "Pilot", "Full Measure" and "Face Off".<br><br>Walt's reflection on the lab equipment is distorted in such a way that he appears to have a goatee and a shaved head.<br><br> Carol compares Walt's appearance to the Unabomber, real name Ted Kaczynski, a terrorist who evaded capture for 17 years despite a federal investigation but who was eventually caught after his sister-in-law and his brother became suspicious of him; this parallels with Hank and Marie's role in catching Heisenberg. Similar to Heisenberg, Kaczynski was also a highly-educated and intelligent mathematician who spent a significant portion of his life living in a remote cabin. Carol's comparison also contrasts with Saul Goodman's comparison of Walt's appearance to that of D. B. Cooper in "Better Call Saul"; D. B. Cooper, who stole $200,000 from airline passengers in 1971, was never caught.<br><br>The device Walt used to control the M60 is a Chinese made UN-4001 Central Car Lock System, a remote-controlled central car lock. The letters UN on the box is covered by a bar code sticker, but largely uncensored. It is the only Chinese product in the show to be shown as Chinese. Statistically, it is the most commonly used remote car lock in China.<br><br>The outfit Walt wears when he arrives at the compound is identical to what he wore in "Pilot" (pastel jacket, green button-up shirt, white undershirt, beige slacks). He begins and ends the series in the same clothes.<br><br> While assembling the M60, Walt hums "El Paso" to himself, after hearing it playing in his car at the beginning of the episode. This could be a callback to when he hummed "Horse With No Name" to himself after hearing it playing in his car in "Caballo Sin Nombre".<br><br>Todd Alquist, Walter White and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle are, in sequence, the fourth, fifth and sixth main characters to die.<br><br>Jack's death mirrors Hank's; as Hank was shot by Jack as Walt offered Jack all his money to spare him, Jack is shot by Walt attempting to offer him his money back to spare him. They were also both shot in the head midsentence.<br><br>Despite its being a recurring element throughout the show, Lydia is the only person to have been successfully killed with ricin.<br><br>Several takes were shot of Walt's blood stained hand sliding down the stainless steel tank. Vince Gilligan selected the one where a "W" (for Walter White) is created by the smear.<br><br>The lyrics "A deep burning pain in my side" in the song "El Paso" parallels what happens to Walt towards the end of this episode.<br><br>His death also reflects "El Paso" by how the cowboy died in the arms of his lover, Walter died amidst the empire he loved.<br><br><br><br>The lyrics "The special love I had for you, my baby blue" in the song "Baby Blue" by Badfinger reflect on Walt's actual love and respect for his own exclusive signature product Blue Sky.<br><br>Vince Gilligan explained that The Searchers heavily influenced the final standoff between Walt and Jesse. Gilligan believes that Walt was intending to kill Jesse, but when he saw the state his former partner was in, Walt couldn’t do it.<br><br>There was one scene cut from the finale script for budget and time reasons. It took place at the gas station after Walt makes the call in which he pretends he's the Times reporter. In it, a former student of Walt recognizes him. Walt pays him off and threatens him to make sure he doesn't rat him out. But before leaving the former student, he asks, "What kind of teacher was I?" The former student replies, "You were good" and then says he remembered the time Walt sprayed different chemicals at a flame and it made different colors.<br><br>Walt's last word is 'Lydia'.<br><br>Some fans still joke about whether or not Huell is still sitting in the safe house, for Hank never told him it was safe for him to leave. Funny or Die even made a video parodying this. However, Gilligan revealed that Huell was let out once Agent Van Oster found out that Hank and Gomez had died, and that "right now, he’s doing what Huell does best, whatever that is. He’s out and about as a free man."<br><br>The license plate of the Cadillac reads "JG8-516", whereas "516" is a hint for this episode, which is the sixteenth episode of the fifth season.<br><br>The entire series began and ended with sirens heading towards Walter.<br><br> Judging by the way Walt talks to Skyler about his confrontation with the neo-Nazis and the fact that Walt wanted Jesse to shoot him, it can be concluded that Walt had planned to get himself killed with the M60 along with Jack's gang before finding out Jesse's condition. Although unknown, it can be assumed. Coincidentally, in the first episode of the series, Walter tries to shoot himself (unsuccessfully).<br><br> As the camera pans out from Walt's body, the lighting fixture forms a crosshair and settles over his left lung. This throws back to his initial CT Scan, and future references where Walt stated he had a tumor in his left lung.<br><br> Co-executive producer Melissa Bernstein can be seen in the bus when Walt Jr. comes home from school. It is a voluntary wink to the "Pilot", in which for lack of budget, she had played the sole occupant of the school bus seen during the scene where Walter accompanies Hank on a drug bust.<br><br> This episode was watched by 10.28 million people on its premiere night, up from the previous high, "Granite State", which had 6.58 million. This makes "Felina" the most watched episode in the series' history.[1]<br><br> The finale also set new records on Twitter, with 1.24 million tweets from 601,370 unique users during the live broadcast of both the EST and PST telecasts. The Breaking Bad finale hit a peak of 22,373 "tweets"-per-minute as the final episode began on the East Coast. Popular Breaking Bad-related Twitter tags included: "#BreakingBad", "#BreakingBadFinale", and "#GoodbyeBreakingBad"; all of which were trending on Twitter that night.<br><br><br><br>Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) does not appear in this episode.<br><br>RJ Mitte (Walter White Jr.) does not have any speaking lines in this episode.<br><br>Vince Gilligan had Walt leave his watch at the gas station for continuity reasons, as he wasn't wearing it during the flashforwards in earlier episodes.[2] ("Live Free or Die") ("Blood Money")<br><br>Leaving the Tag Heuer watch may also be symbolic that "time has run out" for Walt, or it may be symbolic of Walt leaving behind his prideful, selfish, "Heisenberg" self, who was overly focused on greed and power, symbolized by the watch. Many of Heisenberg's worst actions were taken after he received the watch as a gift.<br><br><br><br>Gilligan almost didn't get to use Baby Blue, but the music supervisor said it was the best choice in the end.<br><br>The song Baby Blue by Badfinger saw a 9000% increase in streams, and more than 5000 Itunes sales the night Felina aired, putting it in the top 20 iTunes songs 40 years after it was initially released.<br><br><br><br>In the final scene between Skyler and Walt:<br><br>Anna Gunn wore oversized clothing (like Cranston often does) to make her look like a "shrunken person" and a "shadow of her former self."<br><br>The shot of Skyler reflected in the microwave was completely accidental. Gilligan admits not knowing he got it until the editor complimented it.<br><br>The camera operator cried shooting the final Skyler and Walt scene, and had to take his eye off the eyepiece.<br><br><br><br>Walt's machine gun robot was recreated on an episode of Mythbusters.<br><br>Walter's death, despite general acceptance from fans, is widely disputed. Logically, Walter could survive and Cranston has since teased this theory by stating "You didn't see a body bag" in an interview.<br><br><br><br>Production<br><br>Credits<br><br>Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bryan Cranston as Walter White<br><br>Anna Gunn as Skyler White<br><br>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman<br><br>Dean Norris as Hank Schrader (flashback only)<br><br>Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader<br><br><br><br><br><br>RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr.<br><br>Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (credit only)<br><br>Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle<br><br>Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist<br><br><br><br><br><br>Guest Starring<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Matt Jones as Badger<br><br>Charles Baker as Skinny Pete<br><br>Michael Bowen as Jack Welker<br><br><br><br><br><br>Kevin Rankin as Kenny<br><br>Adam Godley as Elliott Schwartz<br><br>Jessica Hecht as Gretchen Schwartz<br><br><br><br><br><br>Co-Starring<br><br>Patrick Sane as Frankie<br><br>Tait Fletcher as Lester<br><br>Matthew T.
